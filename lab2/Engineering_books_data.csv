"Soil Mechanics of Earthworks, Foundations and Highway Engineering",,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/01/c8/78/01c87896be8bcaca52e07c089af05f6f.jpg,"
                    This is the third volume of a handbook which covers the whole field of soil mechanics, discussing deterministic and stochastic theories and methods, and showing how they can be used in conjunction with one another. The first volume discusses soil physics, while the second deals with the determination of physical characteristics of the soil.  Australian Mining wrote of the Handbook ``a valuable addition to the extensive literature on the topic and will be found to be more useful than most.''The main objective of the third volume is to present solutions to the problems of engineering practice. It deals with the most important theoretical and practical problems of soil mechanics, discussing the following in detail: stability of earthworks, load-bearing capacity and settlement of shallow foundations, design of pile foundations, soil mechanics in road construction, improving the physical properties of soils, the characteristics of soil dynamics, foundations for machines and soil behaviour as affected by earthquakes. The book not only presents up-to-date deterministic methods, but also discusses solutions of probability theory in the fields of design and safety.The book is divided into six chapters covering the stability of slopes, landslides, load-bearing capacity and settlement of shallow foundations and pile foundations, soil mechanics in road construction, and the improvement of the physical characteristics of soil with special emphasis on machine foundations and earthquakes, giving detailed treatment of each subject. For example, the first chapter deals not only with the stability of slopes, but also discusses the natural and artificial effects, slope protection, filter design, stresses in embankments, and the time factor. In this way, the book gives a clear and comprehensive picture of the special fields of soil mechanics and its subjects. It is therefore emminently suitable for postgraduate engineers, and engineers working in the fields of geotechnics, earthworks, foundations, road construction, engineering geology and statistics, and the design of structures.

                    Residual soils are found in many parts of the world. Like other soils, they are used extensively in construction, being built upon and used as construction materials. Residual soils are formed when the processes of rock weathering proceed at a faster rate than the transport processes by water, gravity and wind, whereby much of the resulting soils will remain in place. The soil typically retains many of the characteristics of the parent rock. In a tropical region, residual soil layers can be very thick, sometimes extending for hundred of meters before reaching unweathered rock.    This book has gathered state-of-the-art knowledge from a number of experienced experts working in foundation engineering in tropical residual soils. Subjects covered are: geology and formation of residual soils, site investigations, characterization and selection of parameters for foundation design, design of shallow and deep foundations which include driven piles, drilled shafts and caissons, and special topics which include design of piles in marginally-stable river banks, micro piles, Augeo pile, pile load and NDT, foundation failures and remedial works, and pile supported embankment. The book also includes a country case study on engineering geology in relation to foundation engineering in Malaysia.

In Thermal Physics: Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics for Scientists and Engineers, the fundamental laws of thermodynamics are stated precisely as postulates and subsequently connected to historical context and developed mathematically. These laws are applied systematically to topics such as phase equilibria, chemical reactions, external forces, fluid-fluid surfaces and interfaces, and anisotropic crystal-fluid interfaces. Statistical mechanics is presented in the context of information theory to quantify entropy, followed by development of the most important ensembles: microcanonical, canonical, and grand canonical. A unified treatment of ideal classical, Fermi, and Bose gases is presented, including Bose condensation, degenerate Fermi gases, and classical gases with internal structure. Additional topics include paramagnetism, adsorption on dilute sites, point defects in crystals, thermal aspects of intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors, density matrix formalism, the Ising model, and an introduction to Monte Carlo simulation.  Throughout the book, problems are posed and solved to illustrate specific results and problem-solving techniques.Includes applications of interest to physicists, physical chemists, and materials scientists, as well as materials, chemical, and mechanical engineersSuitable as a textbook for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and practicing researchersDevelops content systematically with increasing order of complexitySelf-contained, including nine appendices to handle necessary background and technical details   ",https://1lib.in/dl/2717455/9a083e,610,Elsevier,2015,english,"PDF, 7.57 MB"

                    Written by a world-renowned theoretical physicist, Introduction to Statistical Physics, Second Edition clarifies the properties of matter collectively in terms of the physical laws governing atomic motion. This second edition expands upon the original to include many additional exercises and more pedagogically oriented discussions that fully explain the concepts and applications.    The book first covers the classical ensembles of statistical mechanics and stochastic processes, including Brownian motion, probability theory, and the Fokker–Planck and Langevin equations. To illustrate the use of statistical methods beyond the theory of matter, the author discusses entropy in information theory, Brownian motion in the stock market, and the Monte Carlo method in computer simulations. The next several chapters emphasize the difference between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics—the quantum phase. Applications covered include Fermi statistics and semiconductors and Bose statistics and Bose–Einstein condensation. The book concludes with advanced topics, focusing on the Ginsburg–Landau theory of the order parameter and the special kind of quantum order found in superfluidity and superconductivity.

                    The laws of thermodynamics drive everything that happens in the universe. From the sudden expansion of a cloud of gas to the cooling of hot metal--everything is moved or restrained by four simple laws. Written by Peter Atkins, one of the world's leading authorities on thermodynamics, this powerful and compact introduction explains what these four laws are and how they work, using accessible language and virtually no mathematics. Guiding the reader a step at a time, Atkins begins with Zeroth (so named because the first two laws were well established before scientists realized that a third law, relating to temperature, should precede them--hence the jocular name zeroth), and proceeds through the First, Second, and Third Laws, offering a clear account of concepts such as the availability of work and the conservation of energy. Atkins ranges from the fascinating theory of entropy (revealing how its unstoppable rise constitutes the engine of the universe), through the concept of free energy, and to the brink, and then beyond the brink, of absolute zero.About the Series: Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, Very Short Introductions offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

Soils into which crop plants root and from which they obtain essential minerals and water contain huge arrays of microbes. Many have highly beneficial effects on crop growth and productivity, others are pathogens causing diseases and losses to yield and quality, a few microbes offer protection from these pathogenic forms and others have little or no effect. These intimate and often complex inter-relationships are being explored with increasing success providing exciting opportunities for increasing crop yields and quality in sustainable harmony with the populations of beneficial soil microbes and to the detriment of pathogens. This book explores current knowledge for each of these aspects of soil microbiology and indicates where future progress is most likely to aid in increasing crop productivity by means which are environmentally benign and beneficial.Advanced first degree, post-graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, lecturers, research-leaders, consultants, advisors, crop practitioners and policy makers involved with crop agronomy, biological control, plant pathology, plant breeding, agriculture, soil science, environmental interactions and conservation, and others requiring up to date knowledge of the impact of soil microbiology on sustainable crop production will find this book invaluable.

The world population is projected to reach nine billion by 2050, and in the coming years, global food demand is expected to increase by 50% or more. Higher crop productivity gains in the future will have to be achieved in developing countries through better natural resources management and crop improvement. After nitrogen, phosphorus (P) has more widespread influence on both natural and agricultural ecosystems than any other essential plant element. It has been estimated that 5.7 billion hectares of land worldwide contain insufficient amounts of available P for sustainable crop production, and P deficiency in crop plants is a widespread problem in various parts of the world. However, it has been estimated that worldwide minable P could last less than 40 years. For sustaining future food supplies, it is vital to enhance plant P use efficiency.

The present Volume 4 of the successful monograh package “Multiphase Flow Dynamics”is devoted to selected Chapters of the multiphase fluid dynamics that are important for practical applications but did not find place in the previous volumes. The state of the art of the turbulence modeling in multiphase flows is presented. As introduction, some basics of the single phase boundary layer theory including some important scales and flow oscillation characteristics in pipes and rod bundles are presented. Then the scales characterizing the dispersed flow systems are presented. The description of the turbulence is provided at different level of complexity: simple algebraic models for eddy viscosity, simple algebraic models based on the Boussinesq hypothesis, modification of the boundary layer share due to modification of the bulk turbulence, modification of the boundary layer share due to nucleate boiling. The role of the following forces on the mathematical description of turbulent flows is discussed: the lift force, the lubrication force in the wall boundary layer, and the dispersion force. A pragmatic generalization of the k-eps models for continuous velocity field is proposed containing flows in large volumes and flows in porous structures. A Methods of how to derive source and sinks terms for multiphase k-eps models is presented. A set of 13 single- and two phase benchmarks for verification of k-eps models in system computer codes are provided and reproduced with the IVA computer code as an example of the application of the theory. This methodology is intended to help other engineers and scientists to introduce this technology step-by-step in their own engineering practice.In many practical application gases are solved in liquids under given conditions, released under other conditions and therefore affecting technical processes for good of for bad.

                    Fuel cell systems have now reached a degree of technological maturity and appear destined to form the cornerstone of future energy technologies. But the rapid advances in fuel cell system development have left current information available only in scattered journals and Internet sites. The even faster race toward fuel cell commercialization further leaves the objectivity of many Internet articles open to question. The Fuel Cell Technology Handbook is now here to help, providing the first comprehensive treatment of both the technical and commercial aspects of high and low temperature fuel cells, fuel cell systems, fuel cell catalysis, and fuel generation. The first part of the book addresses the principles of fuel cell technology and summarizes the main concepts, developments, and remaining technical problems, particularly in fueling. The second part explores applications in automotive, stationary, and portable power generation technologies. It also provides an expert's look at future developments in both the technology and its applications.With chapters contributed by experts working in academic and industrial R&D, this handbook forms a reliable, authoritative basis for understanding fuel cell technology, applications, and commercial realities. Whether you're developing fuel cell components, designing a fuel cell system, or just interested in the viability of an application, the Fuel Cell Technology Handbook is the best place to start.

Principles of Physics: From Quantum Field Theory to Classical Mechanics,Jun Ni,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/e4/b8/27/e4b82754be9c00ce96472a987cfcdcfd.jpg,"
                    This book starts from a set of common basic principles to establish the formalisms in all areas of fundamental physics, including quantum field theory, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, general relativity, electromagnetic field, and classical mechanics. Instead of the traditional pedagogic way, the author arranges the subjects and formalisms in a logical-sequential way, i.e. all the formulas are derived from the formulas before them. The formalisms are also kept self-contained. Most of the required mathematical tools are also given in the appendices.  Although this book covers all the disciplines of fundamental physics, the book is concise and can be treated as an integrated entity. This is consistent with the aphorism that simplicity is beauty, unification is beauty, and thus physics is beauty. The book may be used as an advanced textbook by graduate students. It is also suitable for physicists who wish to have an overview of fundamental physics. Readership: This is an advanced graduate or postgraduate level book.

                    Strength of Materials provides a comprehensive overview of the latest theory of strength of materials. The unified theory presented in this book is developed around three concepts: Hooke's Law, Equilibrium Equations, and Compatibility conditions. The first two of these methods have been fully understood, but clearly are indirect methods with limitations. Through research, the authors have come to understand compatibility conditions, which, until now, had remained in an immature state of development. This method, the Integrated Force Method (IFM) couples equilibrium and compatibility conditions to determine forces directly.   The combination of these methods allows engineering students from a variety of disciplines to comprehend and compare the attributes of each. The concept that IFM strength of materials theory is problem independent, and can be easily generalized for solving difficult problems in linear, nonlinear, and dynamic regimes is focused upon. Discussion of the theory is limited to simple linear analysis problems suitable for an undergraduate course in strength of materials. To support the teaching application of the book there are problems and an instructor's manual.

                    Prepared by the Task Committee on Recent Advances in Canal Automation of the Irrigation Delivery and Drainage Systems Committee of the Irrigation and Drainage Council of the Environmental and Water Resources Institute of ASCE. Canal Automation for Irrigation Systems focuses on the technical aspects of modernizing irrigation systems through use of automated canal control systems. Canal automation has always offered an opportunity to save water and improve the efficiency of irrigation water supply projects or irrigation district operations. Recent technological and engineering advances now enable more accurate control of water deliveries throughout all parts of an irrigation project. Using information collected from irrigation systems around the world in conjunction with new advances in control theory research, this Manual of Practice examines how and when to implement canal automation within the context of canal modernization. Topics include: the modernization process, constraints, and concepts; survey of irrigation physical infrastructure; SCADA systems; control operation concepts; canal hydraulic properties; control methods; verification of controller performance; and implementation of control systems. MOP 131 is an essential reference for professionals in agriculture and irrigation engineering, as well as owners, managers, and operators of irrigation water delivery systems.

A sustainable community energy system is an approach to supplying a local community - ranging from a few homes or farms to entire cities - with its energy requirements from renewable energy or high-efficiency co-generation energy sources. Such systems are frequently based on wind power, solar power, biomass, either singly or in combination. Community energy projects have been growing in numbers in several key regions. This book provides an overview of existing and emerging community energy technologies. Topics covered include data-driven methods for prediction of small to medium wind turbines performance; optimisation of wind farms for communities; financing for community wind and photovoltaic project development; community-level solar thermal systems; solar water desalination for small communities; community solar photovoltaic projects; assessing wind loads for urban photovoltaic installations; design optimisation of multi-energy hubs for community energy projects; battery based storage for communities; power-to-gas and power-to-power for storage and ancillary services in urban areas; smart multi-energy microgrids; and conservation and demand management in community energy systems. Wind and Solar Based Energy Systems for Communities is essential reading for researchers and engineers working to develop community energy systems and advance the transition to a clean energy future.

                    ""Preface In the 1990s, surveying and mapping underwent a transition from disciplineoriented technologies, such as geodesy, surveying, photogrammetry, and cartography, to the methodology-oriented integrated discipline of geoinformatics. This is based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), or GPS, positioning, remote sensing, digital photography for data acquisition, and a geographic information system (GIS) for data manipulation and data output. This book attempts to present the required basic background for remote sensing, digital photogrammetry, and GIS in the new geoinformatics concept in which the different methodologies must be combined. For remote sensing, the basic fundamentals are the properties of electromagnetic radiation and their interaction with matter. This radiation is received by sensors and platforms in an analogue or digital form, and is subject to image processing. In photogrammetry, the stereo concept is used for the location of information in 3D. With the advent of high-resolution satellite systems in stereo, the theory of analytical photogrammetry restituting 2D image information into 3D is of increasing importance, merging the remote sensing approach with that of photogrammetry. The result of the restitution is a direct input into geographic information systems in vector or raster form. The fundamentals of these are described in detail, with an emphasis on global, regional, and local applications. In the context of data integration, a short introduction to the GPS satellite positioning system is provided. This book will appeal to a wide range of readers from advanced undergraduates to all professionals in the growing field of geoinformation""-- Read more...

                    Surveying and mapping has recently undergone a transition: from discipline-oriented technologies, such as geodesy, surveying, photogrammetry and cartography, to the methodology-oriented integrated discipline of geoinformatics based on GPS positioning, remote sensing, digital photography and GIS for data manipulation and data output. This book presents the required basic background for remote sensing, digital photogrammetry and GIS in the new geoinformatics concept in which the different methodologies must be combined.For remote sensing, the basic fundamentals are the properties of electromagnetic radiation and their interaction with matter. This radiation is received by sensors and platforms in analogue or digital form, and is subject to image processing. In photogrammetry, the stereo-concept is used for the location of information in 3D. With the advent of high-resolution satellite systems in stereo, the theory of analytical photogrammetry restituting 2-D image information into 3D is of increasing importance, merging the remote sensing approach with that of photogrammetry. The result of the restitution is a direct input into geographical information systems in vector or in raster form. The fundamentals of these are described in detail, with an emphasis on global, regional and local applications. For data integration, a short introduction into the GPS Satellite positioning system is added. This textbook will appeal to a wide range of readers, from advanced undergraduates to all professionals in the growing field of geoinformation.

Measuring Current Voltage and Power Handbook of Sensors and Actuators Vol 7,K. Iwansson,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/34/9f/bb/349fbba1480936c2a76cd90f18ccf21f.jpg,"
This authoritative new book focuses on recent developments in the instrumentation for sending voltages and currents. It covers new trends and challenges in the field, such as measurements of biocurrents, the increased speed of the components for data taking, testing of computers and integrated circuits where the measurement of rapid voltage and current variations on a very small geometrical scale is necessary. The first chapter concentrates on recent methods to sense voltages and currents, while the rest of the book investigates the applied side, covering for instance electrical power and energy measurements. The main purpose of this volume is to illustrate commonly employed techniques rather than track the scientific evolution and merits and therefore mainly covers patent literature aimed at industrial applications. It is an exciting addition, justifying the series' claim to cover state-of-the-art developments in both the applied and theoretical fields of sensors and actuators.The measurement of voltages and currents is a common task in the field of electricity and electronics. From a technical point of view it is useful to identify schematically different steps of such a measurement. In a first step a voltage or a current is sensed, intermediate steps such as amplification, transmission and further treatment may follow to yield the result in the final step. Today in most cases microprocessors perform the final steps of such measurements. Analog-to digital converters digitise a voltage that is proportional to the value to be measured and a processor performs further computations and handles the storage and the display of the results. The prerequisite for such measurements are sensors or transducers that respond in a known way to the voltage or current to be measured. The emphasis of this book is put on recent developments of the instrumentation for sensing voltages and currents.Aside from the general trend towards smaller, cheaper and more reliable instrumentation, new demands have arisen. New applications, like measurements of biocurrents, ask for higher sensitivities. Computers and integrated circuits pose new challenges. To exploit the increased speed of the components for data taking, suitable sensors are required. The accuracy that can be achieved depends more than ever on the first step, the acquisition of the raw data. The influence of the measurement process on the results becomes more crucial. Testing of integrated circuits themselves is a completely new application. For such tests one has to measure rapid voltage and current variations on very small geometrical scales. Here, as well as in the traditional high voltage applications, contactless measurements play an important role.The organisation of this book is as follows: In the first chapter different methods to sense voltages and currents are described. For the sake of completeness most commonly used methods are mentioned, we concentrate, however, on those developed recently. The chapters address the subject from the side of different applications in which voltages and currents are sensed.Since the main purpose of this publication is to illustrate commonly employed techniques rather than to track the scientific evolution and merits in particular fields, in general those publications that illustrate a particular measurement principle best have been cited. The citation of a particular reference does therefore not imply that this is the first or most pertinent publication in the respective field.

                    The field of electrical measurement continues to grow, with new techniques developed each year. From the basic thermocouple to cutting-edge virtual instrumentation, it is also becoming an increasingly ""digital"" endeavor. Books that attempt to capture the state-of-the-art in electrical measurement are quickly outdated. Recognizing the need for a text devoted to the major areas underlying modern electrical measurement, Slawomir Tumanski developed Principles of Electrical Measurement.This text builds a solid foundation in the necessary background concepts and fundamentals needed to develop and use modern electrical instruments. The author first introduces the fundamentals-including main terms and definitions, methods of estimating accuracy and uncertainty, and standards of electrical quantities-and the classical methods of measurement. He then delves into data acquisition, signal conditioning, and signal processing for both analog and digital signals. The final chapter examines computer measuring systems and virtual measurement techniques. By focusing on the aspects that are common to all types of electrical measurement, the book ensures a solid understanding that can be easily applied in practice.Whether used as an introduction to the field or as a reference to the essential concepts, Principles of Electrical Measurement provides the knowledge necessary to develop measurement solutions for any application.

The Tao of Measurement: A Philosophical View of Flow and Sensors,Jesse Yoder,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/74/16/20/7416209da50e758d3b7b3702523e261e.jpg,"
                    This book deals with the past, present, and future of flow, sensors, and measurement. It is called The Tao of Measurement because, like the Tao itself, it reveals the underlying principles of flow and measurement. It explains the engineering and physics of flow and sensors, how our units of measurement were derived, present day measurement practices, and how today s scientific tools can improve our units of measurement. It s a must-read for anyone involved in instrumentation or process control. The book s opening chapters explore the technologies of temperature, pressure, and flow measurement. The authors reveal the history of units of measurement and describe how they came to be used today. The book then presents a thorough discussion of the different types of temperature sensors, pressure transmitters, and flowmeters. It contains an explanation of applications, and then comments on trends in sensors and measurement. Each chapter includes a handy glossary of units of measurement. The authors then turn their attention to three very familiar but vital subjects: time, length and area. They trace the origins of today s units of measurement for these variables, all the way back to Greek and Roman times, then follow their development to today s atomic clocks and the standard meter, now defined in terms of wavelengths of light. This book describes how modern technology can be used to improve units of measurement. It paints a picture of a dynamic and changing universe, one in which systems can be integrated with improved measurement practices. It looks beyond the static nature of everyday objects to an underlying reality that is dynamic and changing. It describes the technologies that are available to effectively configure a cost-effective system, and then shows how to integrate this system with the most powerful sensors and tools of flow measurement. Systems and instrumentation, the yin and yang of the automation world, are finally united in a synthesis that comes from seeing both from a single perspective. The Tao of measurement is revealed, and in the end, it is all about flow. Each section of the book can be used as a standalone handbook or as a readable engineering manual. Questions? Comments?

                    The Childhood Hand that Disturbs (CHaD), a new projective test, is a diagnostic and therapeutic tool that is broadly applicable, but particularly effective with abused, depressed, and suicidal subjects. While the CHaD has the advantage of being quick and easy to administer--it takes an average of ten minutes to perform--it is reliable and applicable to both young and old. It is a useful complement to traditional batteries such as the Rorschach and Draw-a-Family, and self-assessment questionnaires. What makes the CHaD different is that it is a free drawing exam, and one that taps one of the most highly symbolic parts of the body: the hand. The CHaD has been tested on normal and pathological individuals for over ten years. Clear guidelines can now be set down for administration, testing, and interpretation. Obviously, a projective test can never be more sensitive than the professional who uses it, but it is Davido's intention that the theoretical underpinnings and her presentations of case studies along with the drawings will help other practitioners deal better with the needs of their patients.

The Emotional Life Interview: A Psychosocial Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedure,Henry,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/67/3f/55/673f5587ec79dce0ff7d18d773b4a881.jpg,"
                    The purpose of this book is to introduce mental health professionals to the Emotional Life Interview that offers therapy to those with mental health problems in a more effective and time-sensitive process. It meets today s pressures to provide essential care at less cost. The Emotional Life Interview (ELI) involves asking each client seven questions about five negative feelings and emotions (fear, anger, shame, guilt, and sadness) and six questions about two positive feelings and emotions (pride and happiness). The process takes the practitioner into the emotional life of a client as no other procedure does. Major sections of the book discuss feelings, emotions, and psychotherapy; meaning, arousal, and the construction of emotions; and the use of the ELI in psychosocial treatment. In addition, nine complete chapters are devoted to case histories which illustrate how important feelings, emotions, and relationships are in mental health problems. These case study interviews become conversations in which the clients reveal the character of their consciousness with respect to their emotional lives. The ELI questions presented in the case studies require clients to represent their thoughts and actions in words and to tell their emotional life stories in a manner that is itself therapeutic. The life stories show in bold relief where changes are needed. The Emotional Life Interview provides a framework for emotional life education. The interview puts diagnosis and psychotherapy on the same continuum and makes therapy and emotional life education a viable healthcare option. The book represents a valuable new tool for all clinical and counseling psychologists, clinical social workers, psychiatrists, and primary care providers. It will also serve as a resource in the helping professions, welfare work, and human services.

The Leiden-Edinburgh Boerhaave Course on 'The Gastro-intestinal Tract', held in Leiden on October 29 and 30, 1969, resulted from the renewed co-operation between the Medical Faculties of Edinburgh and Leiden, based on very old ties. As one will know, the Edinburgh Faculty of Medi­ cine was founded in 1726 on the principles guiding the Leiden Faculty of Medicine at that time, on the instigation of John Monro I, who had studied medicine in Leiden under the famous Boerhaave. These old ties were revived some 8 years ago, first by students, later by the Faculties themselves, with the special purpose to facilitate and en­ large the exchange of medical knowledge between two medical centres. One of the results of this was that it was considered whether physicians from both countries could not profit from the knowledge gained specific­ ally in both these faculties by letting the investigators from both faculties tell about their work within the framework of courses for post-academic medical training, in Leiden called the 'Boerhaave Courses'.

This book presents a new meta-heuristic algorithm, inspired by the self-defense mechanisms of plants in nature. Numerous published works have demonstrated the various self-defense mechanisms (survival strategies) plants use to protect themselves against predatory organisms, such as herbivorous insects. The proposed algorithm is based on the predator–prey mathematical model originally proposed by Lotka and Volterra, consisting of two nonlinear first-order differential equations, which allow the growth of two interacting populations (prey and predator) to be modeled. The proposed meta-heuristic is able to produce excellent results in several sets of benchmark optimization problems. Further, fuzzy logic is used for dynamic parameter adaptation in the algorithm.

This book deals with the adhesion, friction and contact mechanics of living organisms. Further, it presents the remarkable adhesive abilities of the living organisms which inspired the design of novel micro- and nanostructured adhesives that can be used in various applications, such as climbing robots, reusable tapes, and biomedical bandages. The technologies for both the synthesis and construction of bio-inspired adhesive micro- and nanostructures, as well as their performance, are discussed in detail. Representatives of several animal groups, such as insects, spiders, tree frogs, and lizards, are able to walk on (and therefore attach to) tilted, vertical surfaces, and even ceilings in different environments. Studies have demonstrated that their highly specialized micro- and nanostructures, in combination with particular surface chemistries, are responsible for this impressive and reversible adhesion. These structures can maximize the formation of large effective contact areas on surfaces of varying roughness and chemical composition under different environmental conditions.

Bio- and Chemo-Mechanical Processes in Geotechnical Engineering: Géotechnique Symposium in Print 2013,Lyesse Laloui,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/96/60/74/96607480c64fa8e1b8e2988539ec7d8c.jpg,"
                    In recent years, substantial advances have been made in understanding the coupling between chemical and biological processes and mechanical and hydraulic behaviours in soils and rocks. At the same time, experimentation and modelling capabilities have progressed significantly, allowing effective design of geotechnical applications. The need for such analyses arises, for example, in chemical and biological soil improvement; nuclear, hazardous and municipal waste containment; petroleum and natural gas extraction; methane hydrate exploitation; CO2 sequestration; and assessment of pavement durability.

The seventeenth Géotechnique Symposium in Print took place at the Institution of Civil Engineers on 3 June 2013 and sought to address the new challenges that are emerging from the interactions between multi-physical phenomena. These proceedings bring together the international research presented at the symposium and published across two issues of Géotechnique as well as additional subsequent research published in the journal.

The papers selected for the symposium cover a wide range of geotechnical processes, including:

- Experimental analysis and constitutive modelling of the bio- and chemo-mechanical behaviour of geomaterials.
- Effects of changes in the pore water chemistry on soil and rock behaviour.
- Interactions between geometrical scales of diverse biological, chemical, physical and mechanical processes.
- Case studies of chemical and biological soil modifications.

This monograph presents the latest results related to bio-mechanical systems and materials. The bio-mechanical systems with which his book is concerned are prostheses, implants, medical operation robots and muscular re-training systems. To characterize and design such systems, a multi-disciplinary approach is required which involves the classical disciplines of mechanical/materials engineering and biology and medicine. The challenge in such an approach is that views, concepts or even language are sometimes different from discipline to discipline and the interaction and communication of the scientists must be first developed and adjusted. Within the context of materials' science, the book covers the interaction of materials with mechanical systems, their description as a mechanical system or their mechanical properties.

Buried Waste in the Seabed; Acoustic Imaging and Bio-toxicity,Philippe Blondel,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/d9/b1/7a/d9b17a387ec63dab9c37e493bf335c69.jpg,"
                    Buried waste on the seabed is a major source of pollution. But, very often, waste sites are not known until aserious problem occurs, or are not adequately mapped. Recent examples around Europe include WWI and WWII ammunition dump sites (e.g. Beufort Dyke in the UK), dumped nuclear submarines in the Arctic Seas, clandestine or hidden toxic-waste in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea.. Even if properly documented, waste sites evolve with time (dumped material can movewith currents and tides, especially on a scale of decades; toxic-material barrels can corrode and leak). This book shows the results of a concerted EU-funded effort to tackle this problem and find innovative ways to identify and map toxic waste sites ona the seabed, whether they have been covered with sediments or not. These results are applicable to any region on the seabed in the entire world.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/679034/526837,244,Springer,2006,english,"PDF, 7.05 MB"

                    Water Chemistry provides students with the tools necessary to understand the processes that control the chemical species present in waters of both natural and engineered systems. After providing basic information about water itself and the chemical composition of water in environmental systems, the text covers the necessary theory (thermodynamics, activity, and kinetics) and background material to solve problems. It emphasizes that both equilibrium and kinetic processes are important in aquatic systems. The book does not merely focus on inorganic constituents, but also on the fate and reactions of organic chemicals.The solving of quantitative equilibrium and kinetic problems using mathematical, graphical, and computational tools is emphasized throughout presentations on acid-base chemistry, complexation of metal ions, solubility of minerals, and oxidation-reduction reactions. The use of these problem-solving tools is then extended in the presentation of topics relevant to natural systems, including dissolved oxygen, nutrient chemistry, geochemical controls on chemical composition, photochemistry, and natural organic matter. The kinetics and equilibria relevant to engineered systems (e.g., chlorination and disinfection chemistry, sorption and surface chemistry) and organic contaminant chemistry are also discussed. Numerous in-chapter examples that show the application of theory and demonstrate how problems are solved using algebraic, graphical, and computer-based techniques are included. Examples are relevant to both natural waters and engineered systems.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/1161974/a4e0fe,809,"Oxford University Press, USA",2011,english,"PDF, 4.63 MB"

                    Learn physics, engineering, and geology concepts usually seen in high school and college in an easy, accessible style.
This second volume addresses these topics for advanced science fair participants or those who just like reading about and understanding science. 3D Printed Science Project Volume 2 describes eight open-source 3D printable models, as well as creative activities using the resulting 3D printed pieces. The files are designed to print as easily as possible, and the authors give tips for printing them on open source printers.
As 3D printers become more and more common and affordable, hobbyists, teachers, parents, and students stall out once they've printed some toys and a few household items. To get beyond this, most people benefit from a “starter set” of objects as a beginning point in their explorations, partially just to see what is possible. This book tells you the solid science stories that these models offer, and provides them in open-source repositories.

What You Will Learn
• Create (and present the science behind) 3D printed models
• Review innovative ideas for tactile ways to learn concepts in engineering, geology and physics
• Learn what makes a models easy or hard to 3D print

                    The first edition of Rock Mechanics and Engineering bridged the gap between scientific research on rock mechanics and practical engineering. It was resolutely aimed at giving practical information to geologists, engineering geologists and engineers. Emphasis was placed on the lessons to be learnt from the study of case histories, with the Malpasset Dam rupture and the large Vajont rock slide amongst those described. In this second, enlarged edition the author continues to emphasise aspects of rock mechanics. Modern efforts at establishing an engineering classification of rocks are summarised and considerable attention is given to the Austrian tunnelling method. Firm in his belief that there is no better way to study the subject than by the detailed analysis of case histories, Dr Jaeger has incorporated a number of new ones, for example the discussion on the engineering classification of jointed rock masses and the required rock support is illustrated by descriptions of the second Gotthard Tunnel and the design of the third, much larger tunnel.

                    This book is written to explain the influence ground conditions can have upon engineering with rocks and soils, and upon designing, analysing and executing an engineered response to the geological and geomorphological processes acting on them; these subjects form the essence of Engineering Geology. The text is written for students of the subject, either geologists or engineers, who encounter the challenge of idealising the ground and its processes for the purposes of design and of quantifying them for the purpose of analysis. With this in mind the book describes how geology can dictate the design of ground investigations, influence the interpretation of its findings, and be incorporated into design and analysis. The reader is constantly reminded of basic geology; the ""simple"" things that constitute the ""big picture"", a neglect of which may cause design and analyses to be at fault, and construction not to function as it should.

                    Geologic hazards pose the greatest threat to human safety for any geotechnical undertaking, but it is ultimately the engineer's ability to recognize and cope with these hazards that will determine the safety of life and property. Armed with Geologic Hazards: A Field Guide for Geotechnical Engineers you will be able to properly recognize, understand various geologic hazards, and provide safe and economical construction. Eminent expert Roy E. Hunt thoroughly examines the potential for slope failures, earthquakes, ground subsidence, collapse, and expansion. Using a clear conceptual approach, he explains what measures are available to minimize or eliminate the risks associated with each of these geologic hazards.
The book sets forth the basis for recognizing, understanding, and treating geologic hazards, using general concepts rather than rigorous mathematical analyses. The author covers the prediction of slope failures through recognition of geologic and other factors that govern failure, the treatment of slopes that are potentially unstable and pose a danger to some existing development, the design and construction of stable cut slopes and sidehill fills, and the stabilization of failed slopes. He provides the foundation for determining the potential for surface movements and for preventing or controlling their effects. A section on earthquakes summarizes and links all of the aspects of earthquakes including their causes, characteristics, and surface effects. It provides a thorough grounding in how to recognize hazard potential and minimize the consequences.

                    Strength of Materials provides a comprehensive overview of the latest theory of strength of materials. The unified theory presented in this book is developed around three concepts: Hooke's Law, Equilibrium Equations, and Compatibility conditions. The first two of these methods have been fully understood, but clearly are indirect methods with limitations. Through research, the authors have come to understand compatibility conditions, which, until now, had remained in an immature state of development. This method, the Integrated Force Method (IFM) couples equilibrium and compatibility conditions to determine forces directly.   The combination of these methods allows engineering students from a variety of disciplines to comprehend and compare the attributes of each. The concept that IFM strength of materials theory is problem independent, and can be easily generalized for solving difficult problems in linear, nonlinear, and dynamic regimes is focused upon. Discussion of the theory is limited to simple linear analysis problems suitable for an undergraduate course in strength of materials. To support the teaching application of the book there are problems and an instructor's manual.

                    One of the most important subjects for any student of engineering or materials to master is the behaviour of materials and structures under load.  The way in which they react to applied forces, the deflections resulting and the stresses and strains set up in the bodies concerned are all vital considerations when designing a mechanical component such that it will not fail under predicted load during its service lifetime.  Building upon the fundamentals established in the introductory volume Mechanics of Materials 1, this book extends the scope of  material covered into more complex areas such as unsymmetrical bending, loading and deflection of struts, rings, discs, cylinders plates, diaphragms and thin walled sections.  There is a new treatment of the Finite Element Method of analysis, and more advanced topics such as contact and residual stresses, stress concentrations, fatigue, creep and fracture are also covered.  Each chapter contains a summary of the essential formulae which are developed in the chapter, and a large number of worked examples which progress in level of difficulty as the principles are enlarged upon.  In addition, each chapter concludes with an extensive selection of problems for solution by the student, mostly examination questions from professional and academic bodies, which are graded according to difficulty and furnished with answers at the end.

                    One of the most important subjects for any student of engineering to master is the behaviour of materials and structures under load.  The way in which they react to applied forces, the deflections resulting and the stresses and strains set up in the bodies concerned are all vital considerations when designing a mechanical component such that it will not fail under predicted load during its service lifetime.  All the essential elements of a treatment of these topics are contained within this course of study, starting with an introduction to the concepts of stress and strain, shear force and bending moments and moving on to the examination of bending, shear and torsion in elements such as beams, cylinders, shells and springs.  A simple treatment of complex stress and complex strain leads to a study of the theories of elastic failure and an introduction to the experimental methods of stress and strain analysis.More advanced topics are dealt with in a companion volume - Mechanics of Materials 2.  Each chapter contains a summary of the essential formulae which are developed in the chapter, and a large number of worked examples which progress in level of difficulty as the principles are enlarged upon.  In addition, each chapter concludes with an extensive selection of problems for solution by the student, mostly examination questions from professional and academic bodies, which are graded according to difficulty and furnished with answers at the end.                                       * Emphasis on practical learning and applications, rather than theory* Provides the essential formulae for each individual chapter* Contains numerous worked examples and problems                ",https://1lib.in/dl/896461/2b36c4,450,,1997,english,"PDF, 18.23 MB"

                    Christians sometimes approach the Old Testament with a mixture of awe and bewilderment, knowing that it contains pearls of wisdom, but unsure how to dive for them ... especially when it comes to the Prophets.In The Message of the Prophets, author J. Daniel Hays offers a scholarly, yet readable and student-friendly survey of the Old Testament prophetic literature that presents the message of each prophet in its historical and its biblical context and then tracks that message through the New Testament to challenge readers with what it means for them today. Hays focuses on synthesizing the message of the prophets, which enables students to grasp the major contours of the prophetic books clearly and concisely. Hundreds of colorful pictures help to illustrate the historical and cultural background of the prophets. After identifying what the message meant for ancient Israel, Hays helps the readers to move toward theological application today, helping readers to gain a better understanding of God and the relationship between God and his people. The Message of the Prophets is essential for professors, students, and others seeking to understand the role that the OT prophets play in the Christian faith.

                    A new edition of this classic work, comprehensively revised to present exciting new developments in this important subject

The study of numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations is constantly developing and regenerating, and this third edition of a popular classic volume, written by one of the world’s leading experts in the field, presents an account of the subject which reflects both its historical and well-established place in computational science and its vital role as a cornerstone of modern applied mathematics.

In addition to serving as a broad and comprehensive study of numerical methods for initial value problems, this book contains a special emphasis on Runge-Kutta methods by the mathematician who transformed the subject into its modern form dating from his classic 1963 and 1972 papers.  A second feature is general linear methods which have now matured and grown from being a framework for a unified theory of a wide range of diverse numerical schemes to a source of new and practical algorithms in their own right.  As the founder of general linear method research, John Butcher has been a leading contributor to its development; his special role is reflected in the text.  The book is written in the lucid style characteristic of the author, and combines enlightening explanations with rigorous and precise analysis. In addition to these anticipated features, the book breaks new ground by including the latest results on the highly efficient G-symplectic methods which compete strongly with the well-known symplectic Runge-Kutta methods for long-term integration of conservative mechanical systems.

Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations: Finite Difference and Finite Volume Methods focuses on two popular deterministic methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), namely finite difference and finite volume methods. The solution of PDEs can be very challenging, depending on the type of equation, the number of independent variables, the boundary, and initial conditions, and other factors. These two methods have been traditionally used to solve problems involving fluid flow.  For practical reasons, the finite element method, used more often for solving problems in solid mechanics, and covered extensively in various other texts, has been excluded.

                    Accelerating economic development and urbanization has led to engineers becoming increasingly ambitious, carrying out excavations in more difficult soils, so that excavations are deeper and more extensive. These complex conditions require advanced analysis, design methods and construction technologies. Most books on general foundation engineering introduce basic analysis and design of excavation, but do not usually deal with analysis and design in practice. This book covers both areas, introducing methods currently used in modern engineering, which can readily be applied to analysis and design in actual excavations. Based on interaction between research results, analysis and teaching experience, the book is suitable for both teachers and engineers in advanced analysis and design.

What data is required to gauge compliance and performance? How can construction issues and problems quickly be identified, rectified, and not repeated? And as construction works proceeds, what is required to ensure performance is maintained whilst achieving specified quality standards safely and with minimal environmental harm?In answering these questions, this book establishes the role of the construction supervisor, applicable to both the consultant and contractor, as it details how construction should be monitored and verified, and how quality, scope, time, and cost aspects can be effectively managed. As construction supervision is employed to its full potential, it becomes a powerful tool that can ensure that the desired construction performance and later operational performance are achieved. Construction supervision, after all, is key to attaining quality control, safety, and environmental compliance as it ensures that the required and specified things are done as required, first time. In writing this book, the authors have drawn much on their extensive and worldwide in-practice experience to articulate how construction supervision should be conducted, outlining what site information should be captured and how it can be used to assess and influence overall work performance.

                    Tensile surface structures are the visual expression of an intensive rethinking of the topic of building envelopes by designers. Advances in design methods, materials, construction elements and assembly and erection planning in the field of lightweight construction are enabling ever more exacting applications of tensile structures with envelope and structural functions, especially in roofing over large clear spans without internal support.     However, the particular mechanical characteristics of the materials used in the construction of textile structures demand consideration of the question of ""buildability"". This book provides answers by discussing the fundamental influence of material manufacture and assembly in deciding the most suitable type of building or structure and its detailing in the design process.     The fundamentals of material composition, manufacturing process, patterning and the behaviour of flexible structural systems are all explained here, as well as their use as structural and connection elements, and special attention is given to the erection of wide-span lightweight structures.

                    Social Constructionism: Sources and Stirrings in Theory and Practice offers an introduction to the different theorists and schools of thought that have contributed to the development of contemporary social constructionist ideas, charting a course through the ideas that underpin the discipline. From the New Science of Vico in the 18th century, through to Marxist writers, ethnomethodologists and Wittgenstein, ideas as to how socio-cultural processes provide the resources that make us human are traced to the present day. Despite constructionists often being criticised as 'relativists', 'activists' and 'anti-establishment' and for making no concrete contributions, their ideas are now being adopted by practically-oriented disciplines such as management consultancy, advertising, therapy, education and nursing. Andy Lock and Tom Strong aim to provoke a wider grasp of an alternative history and tradition that has developed alongside the one emphasised in traditional histories of the social sciences.

                    Over the past two decades concrete has enjoyed a renewed level of research and testing, resulting in the development of many new types of concrete. Through the use of various additives, production techniques and chemical processes, there is now a great degree of control over the properties of specific concretes for a wide range of applications. New theories, models and testing techniques have also been developed to push the envelope of concrete as a building material. There is no current textbook which brings all of these advancements together in a single volume. This book aims to bridge the gap between the traditional concrete technologies and the emerging state-of-the-art technologies which are gaining wider use.

FRP Composites for Reinforced and Prestressed Concrete Structures: a guide to fundamentals and design for repair and retrofit (Structural Engineering: Mechanics and Design),Peruma Balaguru,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/a5/80/51/a58051e3f86d9cc80485d6ca8b0ba58f.jpg,"
                    High strength fibre composites (FRPs) have been used with civil structures since the 1980s, mostly in the repair, strengthening and retrofitting of concrete structures. This has attracted considerable research, and the industry has expanded exponentially in the last decade. Design guidelines have been developed by professional organizations in a number of countries including USA, Japan, Europe and China, but until now designers have had no publication which provides practical guidance or accessible coverage of the fundamentals.     This book fills this void. It deals with the fundamentals of composites, and basic design principles, and provides step-by-step guidelines for design. Its main theme is the repair and retrofit of un-reinforced, reinforced and prestressed concrete structures using carbon, glass and other high strength fibre composites. In the case of beams, the focus is on their strengthening for flexure and shear or their stiffening. The main interest with columns is the improvement of their ductility; and both strengthening and ductility improvement of un-reinforced structures are covered. Methods for evaluating the strengthened structures are presented. Step by step procedures are set out, including flow charts, for the various structural components, and design examples and practice problems are used to illustrate.    As infrastructure ages worldwide, and its demolition and replacement becomes less of an option, the need for repair and retrofit of existing facilities will increase. Besides its audience of design professionals, this book suits graduate and advanced undergraduate students.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/938912/03239c,336,,2008,english,"PDF, 7.51 MB"

Building for Eternity: The History and Technology of Roman Concrete Engineering in the Sea,C.J. Brandon,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/01/fc/e9/01fce9b581454fc57b8f3218066647c2.jpg,"
                    One marker of the majesty of ancient Rome is its surviving architectural legacy, the stunning remains of which are scattered throughout the circum-Mediterranean landscape. Surprisingly, one truly remarkable aspect of this heritage remains relatively unknown. There exists beneath the waters of the Mediterranean the physical remnants of a vast maritime infrastructure that sustained and connected the western world's first global empire and economy. The key to this incredible accomplishment and to the survival of structures in the hostile environment of the sea for two thousand years was maritime concrete, a building material invented and then employed by Roman builders on a grand scale to construct harbor installations anywhere they were needed, rather than only in locations with advantageous geography or topography.  This book explains how the Romans built so successfully in the sea with their new invention. The story is a stimulating mix of archaeological, geological, historical and chemical research, with relevance to both ancient and modern technology. It also breaks new ground in bridging the gap between science and the humanities by integrating analytical materials science, history, and archaeology, along with underwater exploration. The book will be of interest to anyone interested in Roman architecture and engineering, and it will hold special interest for geologists and mineralogists studying the material characteristics of pyroclastic volcanic rocks and their alteration in seawater brines. The demonstrable durability and longevity of Roman maritime concrete structures may be of special interest to engineers working on cementing materials appropriate for the long-term storage of hazardous substances such as radioactive waste.  A pioneering methodology was used to bore into maritime structures both on land and in the sea to collect concrete cores for testing in the research laboratories of the CTG Italcementi Group, a leading cement producer in Italy, the University of Berkeley, and elsewhere. The resulting mechanical, chemical and physical analysis of 36 concrete samples taken from 11 sites in Italy and the eastern Mediterranean have helped fill many gaps in our knowledge of how the Romans built in the sea. To gain even more knowledge of the ancient maritime technology, the directors of the Roman Maritime Concrete Study (ROMACONS) engaged in an ambitious and unique experimental archaeological project - the construction underwater of a reproduction of a Roman concrete pier or pila. The same raw materials and tools available to the ancient builders were employed to produce a reproduction concrete structure that appears to be remarkably similar to the ancient one studied during ROMACON's fieldwork between 2002-2009.  This volume reveals a remarkable and unique archaeological project that highlights the synergy that now exists between the humanities and science in our continuing efforts to understand the past. It will quickly become a standard research tool for all interested in Roman building both in the sea and on land, and in the history and chemistry of marine concrete. The authors also hope that the data and observations it presents will stimulate further research by scholars and students into related topics, since we have so much more to learn in the years ahead.

                    Durability failures in reinforced concrete structures are wasteful of resources and energy. The introduction to practice of European Standard EN 206-1 represents a significant shift in emphasis on the need to explicitly consider each potential durability threat when specifying and producing concrete. Fundamentals of Durable Reinforced Concrete presents the fundamental aspects of concrete durability including reinforcement corrosion, carbonation, chloride ingress, alkali-aggregate reaction, freeze/thaw damage, sulphate attack, chemical attack, cracking, abrasion and weathering. The background to the durability exposure classes in EN 206-1 is also explained. Future directions in performance-based specifications and mathematical modelling of degradation are presented. This book will be of particular interest to specifiers applying the principles of the new European Standard EN 206-1 for the first time, to postgraduate researchers in mathematical modelling of degradation mechanisms, to undergraduates of engineering, architecture and building technology, and students of advanced concrete technology who require a concise source of reference on concrete durability.

It is, however, a thoroughly modern language, and has strongly influenced the design of other modern languages like ML and Python.The book starts in Scheme, then adds object oriented techniques and assembly language. It finishes with a transition to Java, which is, of course, similar to C++. This approach will provide a much broader background than a typical text using C++ or C could.

This distinctive textbook aims to introduce readers to the basic structures of the mechanics of deformable bodies, with a special emphasis on the description of the elastic behavior of simple materials and structures composed by elastic beams.  The authors take a deductive rather than inductive approach and start from a few first, foundational principles.  A wide selection of exercises, many with hints and solutions, are provided throughout and organized in a way that will allow readers to form a link between abstract mathematical concepts and real-world applications.The text begins with the definition of bodies and deformations, keeping the kinematics of rigid bodies as a special case; the authors also distinguish between material and spatial metrics, defining each one in the pertinent space.  Subsequent chapters cover observers and classes of possible changes; forces, torques, and related balances, which are derived from the invariance under classical changes in observers of the power of the external actions over a body, rather than postulated a priori; constitutive structures; variational principles in linear elasticity; the de Saint-Venant problem; yield criteria and a discussion of their role in the representation of material behavior; and an overview of some bifurcation phenomena, focusing on the Euler rod.  An appendix on tensor algebra and tensor calculus is included for readers who need a brief refresher on these topics.Fundamentals of the Mechanics of Solids is primarily intended for graduate and advanced undergraduate students in various fields of engineering and applied mathematics.  Prerequisites include basic courses in calculus, mathematical analysis, and classical mechanics.

Modern computer simulations make stress analysis easy. As they continue to replace classical mathematical methods of analysis, these software programs require users to have a solid understanding of the fundamental principles on which they are based.  Develop Intuitive Ability to Identify and Avoid Physically Meaningless Predictions  Applied Mechanics of Solids is a powerful tool for understanding how to take advantage of these revolutionary computer advances in the field of solid mechanics. Beginning with a description of the physical and mathematical laws that govern deformation in solids, the text presents modern constitutive equations, as well as analytical and computational methods of stress analysis and fracture mechanics. It also addresses the nonlinear theory of deformable rods, membranes, plates, and shells, and solutions to important boundary and initial value problems in solid mechanics.  The author uses the step-by-step manner of a blackboard lecture to explain problem solving methods, often providing the solution to a problem before its derivation is presented. This format will be useful for practicing engineers and scientists who need a quick review of some aspect of solid mechanics, as well as for instructors and students.    Select and Combine Topics Using Self-Contained Modules and Subsections    Borrowing from the classical literature on linear elasticity, plasticity, and structural mechanics, this book:   Introduces concepts, analytical techniques, and numerical methods used to analyze deformation, stress, and failure in materials or components   Discusses the use of finite element software for stress analysis    Assesses simple analytical solutions to explain how to set up properly posed boundary and initial-value problems   Provides an understanding of algorithms implemented in software code   Complemented by the author’s website, which features problem sets and sample code for self study, this book offers a crucial overview of problem solving for solid mechanics. It will help readers make optimal use of commercial finite element programs to achieve the most accurate prediction results possible.

Principles of Solid Mechanics,Rowland Richards  Jr.,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/60/8f/f6/608ff670665f15c19443d260b298ce06.jpg,"
                    Evolving from more than 30 years of research and teaching experience, Principles of Solid Mechanics offers an in-depth treatment of the application of the full-range theory of deformable solids for analysis and design. Unlike other texts, it is not either a civil or mechanical engineering text, but both. It treats not only analysis but incorporates design along with experimental observation. Principles of Solid Mechanics serves as a core course textbook for advanced seniors and first-year graduate students. The author focuses on basic concepts and applications, simple yet unsolved problems, inverse strategies for optimum design, unanswered questions, and unresolved paradoxes to intrigue students and encourage further study. He includes plastic as well as elastic behavior in terms of a unified field theory and discusses the properties of field equations and requirements on boundary conditions crucial for understanding the limits of numerical modeling.Designed to help guide students with little experimental experience and no exposure to drawing and graphic analysis, the text presents carefully selected worked examples. The author makes liberal use of footnotes and includes over 150 figures and 200 problems. This, along with his approach, allows students to see the full range, non-linear response of structures.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/511898/2f66e9,458,CRC Press,2000,english,"PDF, 7.08 MB"

                    This is a first year graduate textbook in Linear Elasticity. It is written with the practical engineering reader in mind, dependence on previous knowledge of Solid Mechanics, Continuum Mechanics or Mathematics being minimized. Most of the text should be readily intelligible to a reader with an undergraduate background of one or two courses in elementary Mechanics of Materials and a rudimentary knowledge of partial differentiation. Emphasis is placed on engineering applications of elasticity and examples are generally worked through to final expressions for the stress and displacement fields in order to explore the engineering consequences of the results. The Topics covered were chosen with a view to modern research applications in Fracture Mechanics, Composite Materials, Tribology and Numerical Methods. Thus, significant attention is given to crack and contact problems, problems involving interfaces between dissimilar media, thermo elasticity, singular asymptotic stress fields and three-dimensional problems. This second edition includes new chapters on antiplane stress systems, Saint-Venant torsion and bending and an expanded section on three-dimensional problems in spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems, including axisymmetric torsion of bars of non-uniform circular cross-section. It also includes over 200 end-of-chapter problems, which are expressed wherever possible in the form they would arise in engineering - i.e. as a body of a given geometry subjected to prescribed loading - instead of inviting the student to 'verify' that a given candidate stress function is appropriate to the problem. Solution of these problems is considerably facilitated by the use of modern symbolic mathematical languages such as Maple® and Mathematica® and electronic files and hints on this method of solution can be accessed at the web site www.elasticity.org.

From the characterization of materials to accelerated life testing, experimentation with solids and structures is present in all stages of the design of mechanical devices. Sometimes only an experimental model can bring the necessary elements for understanding, the physics under study just being too complex for an efficient numerical model.   This book presents the classical tools in the experimental approach to mechanical engineering, as well as the methods that have revolutionized the field over the past 20 years: photomechanics, signal processing, statistical data analysis, design of experiments, uncertainty analysis, etc.  Experimental Mechanics of Solids and Structures also replaces mechanical testing in a larger context: firstly, that of the experimental model, with its own hypotheses; then that of the knowledge acquisition process, which is structured and robust; finally, that of a reliable analysis of the results obtained, in a context where uncertainty could be important.   ",https://1lib.in/dl/2713894/3ed8b6,176,Wiley-ISTE,2016,english,"PDF, 8.67 MB"

                    The second edition of An Introduction to Nonlinear Finite Element Analysis has the same objective as the first edition, namely, to facilitate an easy and thorough understanding of the details that are involved in the theoretical formulation, finite element model development, and solutions of nonlinear problems. The book offers an easy-to-understand treatment of the subject of nonlinear finite element analysis, which includes element development from mathematical models and numerical evaluation of the underlying physics. The new edition is extensively reorganized and contains substantial amounts of new material. Chapter 1 in the second edition contains a section on applied functional analysis. Chapter 2 on nonlinear continuum mechanics is entirely new. Chapters 3 through 8 in the new edition correspond to Chapter 2 through 8 of the first edition, but with additional explanations, examples, and exercise problems. Material on time dependent problems from Chapter 8 of the first edition is absorbed into Chapters 4 through 8 of the new edition. Chapter 9 is extensively revised and it contains up to date developments in the large deformation analysis of isotropic, composite and functionally graded shells. Chapter 10 of the first edition on material nonlinearity and coupled problems is reorganized in the second edition by moving the material on solid mechanics to Chapter 12 in the new edition and material on coupled problems to the new chapter, Chapter 10, on weak-form Galerkin finite element models of viscous incompressible fluids. Finally, Chapter 11 in the second edition is entirely new and devoted to least-squares finite element models of viscous incompressible fluids. Chapter 12 of the second edition is enlarged to contain finite element models of viscoelastic beams. In general, all of the chapters of the second edition contain additional explanations, detailed example problems, and additional exercise problems. Although all of the programming segments are in Fortran, the logic used in these Fortran programs is transparent and can be used in Matlab or C++ versions of the same. Thus the new edition more than replaces the first edition, and it is hoped that it is acquired by the library of every institution of higher learning as well as serious finite element analysts.The book may be used as a textbook for an advanced course (after a first course) on the finite element method or the first course on nonlinear finite element analysis.

The design of turbine-generator foundations requires advanced technical expertise in structural engineering and soil dynamics, as well as close collaboration with manufacturers, mechanical and electrical engineers, and plant designers. Various manufacturers have different requirements for such foundations, and application of code provisions can demand a significant degree of interpretation. Concrete Foundations for Turbine Generators: Analysis, Design, and Construction provides the practical assistance needed by structural engineers and facility owners to meet these challenges with the most up-to-date and reliable information available. This Manual of Practice addresses the design of three types of concrete foundations for turbine generators: block foundations, with pedestals, piers, and blocks supported on a common mat foundation (basemat); elevated space-frame pedestal foundations, with columns, walls, and a tabletop supported on the basemat; and foundations where equipment or structural elements are supported on a vibration-isolation system. Topics include turbine generator equipment, foundation layout and sizing, foundation loads and load combinations, modeling of soil and pile response to dynamic loads, finite element modeling, serviceability analysis and acceptance criteria, strength and stability design, embedded items, vibration-isolated foundations, and construction considerations. Three appendixes on dynamic impedance discuss soil-supported rigid foundations, pile-supported foundations, and calculation examples.

Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++,Mark A. Weiss,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/10/04/52/100452107988206c2701135ce144cb7b.jpg,"
                    Features
This text is designed to teach students good programming and algorithm analysis skills simultaneously so that they can develop intricate programs with the maximum amount of efficiency.
By analyzing an algorithm before it is actually coded, students can decide if a particular solution will be feasible and see how careful implementations can reduce the time constraint for large amounts of data. No algorithm or data structure is presented without an explanation of its running time.
This book is suitable for either an advanced data structures (CS7) course or a first-year graduate course in algorithm analysis. As introductory sequences expand from two to three courses, this book is ideal at the end of the third course, bridging the way to the Algorithms course.
Discussion of algorithm and design techniques covers greedy algorithms, divide and conquer algorithms, dynamic programming, randomized algorithms, and backtracking.
Covers topics and data structures such as Fibonacci heaps, skew heaps, binomial queue, skip lists and splay trees. 
A full chapter on amortized analysis examines the advanced data structures presented earlier in the book.
Chapter on advanced data structures and their implementation covers red black trees, top down splay trees, k-d trees, pairing heaps, and more. 
End-of-chapter exercises, ranked by difficulty, reinforce the material from the chapter while providing readers an opportunity to put those concepts into practice.

Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++ is an advanced algorithms book that bridges the gap between traditional CS2 and Algorithms Analysis courses.
As the speed and power of computers increases, so does the need for effective programming and algorithm analysis. By approaching these skills in tandem, Mark Allen Weiss teaches readers to develop well-constructed, maximally efficient programs using the C++ programming language.
This book explains topics from binary heaps to sorting to NP-completeness, and dedicates a full chapter to amortized analysis and advanced data structures and their implementation. Figures and examples illustrating successive stages of algorithms contribute to Weiss’ careful, rigorous and in-depth analysis of each type of algorithm.

An Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms,Robert Sedgewick,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/7c/be/aa/7cbeaa9dc0cf8fada4aa644c3348cda9.jpg,"
                    Despite growing interest, basic information on methods and models for mathematically analyzing algorithms has rarely been directly accessible to practitioners, researchers, or students. An Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms, Second Edition, organizes and presents that knowledge, fully introducing primary techniques and results in the field. Robert Sedgewick and the late Philippe Flajolet have drawn from both classical mathematics and computer science, integrating discrete mathematics, elementary real analysis, combinatorics, algorithms, and data structures. They emphasize the mathematics needed to support scientific studies that can serve as the basis for predicting algorithm performance and for comparing different algorithms on the basis of performance. Techniques covered in the first half of the book include recurrences, generating functions, asymptotics, and analytic combinatorics. Structures studied in the second half of the book include permutations, trees, strings, tries, and mappings. Numerous examples are included throughout to illustrate applications to the analysis of algorithms that are playing a critical role in the evolution of our modern computational infrastructure. Improvements and additions in this new edition include:• Upgraded figures and code• An all-new chapter introducing analytic combinatorics• Simplified derivations via analytic combinatorics throughout• The book’s thorough, self-contained coverage will help readers appreciate the field’s challenges, prepare them for advanced results—covered in their monograph Analytic Combinatorics and in Donald Knuth’s The Art of Computer Programming books—and provide the background they need to keep abreast of new research.

A breakthrough trading book that provides powerful insights on profitable technical patterns and strategiesThe Art and Science of Technical Analysisis a groundbreaking work that bridges the gaps between the academic view of markets, technical analysis, and profitable trading. The book explores why randomness prevails in markets most, but not all, of the time and how technical analysis can be used to capture statistically validated patterns in certain types of market conditions. The belief of the book is that buying and selling pressure causes patterns in prices, but that these technical patterns are only effective in the presence of true buying/selling imbalance.The Art and Science of Technical Analysisis supported by extensive statistical analysis of the markets, which will debunk some tools and patterns such as Fibonacci analysis, and endorse other tools and trade setups. In addition, this reliable resource discusses trader psychology and trader learning curves based on the author's extensive experience as a trader and trainer of traders.Offers serious traders a way to think about market problems, understand their own performance, and help find a more productive path forward Includes extensive research to validate specific money-making patterns and strategies Written by an experienced market practitioner who has trained and worked with many top traders Filled with in-depth insights and practical advice,The Art and Science of Technical Analysiswill give you a realistic sense of how markets behave, when and how technical analysis works, and what it really takes to trade successfully.

Presents a novel approach to conducting meta-analysis using structural equation modeling. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and meta-analysis are two powerful statistical methods in the educational, social, behavioral, and medical sciences. They are often treated as two unrelated topics in the literature. This book presents a unified framework on analyzing meta-analytic data within the SEM framework, and illustrates how to conduct meta-analysis using the metaSEM package in the R statistical environment. Meta-Analysis: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach begins by introducing the importance of SEM and meta-analysis in answering research questions. Key ideas in meta-analysis and SEM are briefly reviewed, and various meta-analytic models are then introduced and linked to the SEM framework. Fixed-, random-, and mixed-effects models in univariate and multivariate meta-analyses, three-level meta-analysis, and meta-analytic structural equation modeling, are introduced. Advanced topics, such as using restricted maximum likelihood estimation method and handling missing covariates, are also covered.  Readers will learn a single framework to apply both meta-analysis and SEM.  Examples in R and in Mplus are included.  This book will be a valuable resource for statistical and academic researchers and graduate students carrying out meta-analyses, and will also be useful to researchers and statisticians using SEM in biostatistics. Basic knowledge of either SEM or meta-analysis will be helpful in understanding the materials in this book. ",https://1lib.in/dl/2545140/8eb2d0,408,Wiley,2015,english,"PDF, 2.15 MB"

                    Over the past few years, the field of scheduling has changed dramatically because of the complexity of the problems now involved. This has led many researchers to develop approximation algorithms that can handle these more difficult kinds of scheduling problems. This in turn has resulted in enormous growth of the field and a wide body of knowledge that has never been pulled together into one volume-until now. Handbook of Scheduling:  Algorithms, Models, and Performance Analysis collects all of the up-to-date information on approximation algorithms into one resource that will prove useful to a wide range of users from computer science, industrial engineering, operations research, and management science.

                    New York: McGraw-Hill book company, Inc., 1916. — 504 p.Volumes II and III are essentially devoted to a presentation of the fundamental principles and problems of irrigation engineering. While the author has endeavored to meet specially the needs of teachers and students in technical schools, considerable descriptive information and cost data have been added for the purpose of making these volumes more valuable to the engineers engaged in the construction and operation of irrigation systems. For use as text-books in class-room work, some of the descriptive material and detailed information may be considered only briefly and more emphasis laid on the fundamental principles and on the problems of economic construction.The preparation of these two volumes results in part from the development of a course in Irrigation engineering presented at the University of California. It is based on an acquaintance with a large number of irrigation systems, located in most of the States of the western part of the United States and in western Canada, obtained through many opportunities for examinationof these projects and through connection with a number of them.The writer has not confined himself to his own experience and observations, but has discussed the principles of irrigation engineering presented in this work with a number of successful engineers, who have had much experience in the construction and operation of irrigation systems. He has also availed himself not only of contemporary literature pertaining to American Irrigation engineering, but has consulted a large collection of foreign publications, mostly from India, Egypt, Spain and France. While there is still considerable difference of opinion among engineers regarding some of the principles of design of irrigation works, it is believed that the opinions and principles presented are in accordance with correct theory and good practice as demonstrated by careful observation.This treatise on irrigation engineering, as presented in Volumes II and III, is largely confined to canals and other works which pertain to the usual types of irrigation systems. No attempt has been made to discuss the subject of dams used for the development of storage, and of high masonry dams used for the diversion of water. Excellent books on dams made it unnecessary and undesirable to include a brief presentation of this subject. On the other hand, much space has been devoted to a rather complete consideration of low dams used for diversion weirs.The division of this work in two volumes has been made primarily to avoid an excessively bulky book in one volume.The division has had to be made more or less arbitrarily. Volume II, on The Conveyance of Water, begins with three chapters which pertain to irrigation engineering as a whole, and Volume III, on Irrigation Structures and Distribution System, contains chapters which are closely related to the conveyance of water.

                    New York: McGraw-Hill book company, Inc., 1915. — 254 p.In the preparation of this volume and of the two following larger volumes, the author has endeavored to present a book which will fill the needs of teachers and students in technicalcolleges and universities and which may be used as a reference book by engineers engaged in irrigation work, by managers and superintendents of irrigation systems. In this work the writer has been guided by his experience as a teacher of irrigation practice and engineering for many years and by experience obtained through his professional practice, which has given him opportunities to become acquainted with irrigation practice and projects in most of the states of the western part of the United States and in western Canada.Personal contact with engineers engaged in irrigation work, examination of their reports and plans for proposed irrigation systems and inspection of constructed systems show that engineerswho have had little experience in irrigation work have not considered the relative importance of the agricultural phase of irrigation problems. The planning and construction of an irrigation system cannot be totally separated from the operation of the system. On nearly all new projects the completion of the construction of a system and the operation of the system must be carried on at the same time, usually both under the direction of the chief engineer. Where an old system is to be extended, construction and operation must be carried jointly. It usually develops that the experience obtained by the engineer in planning and constructing a system makes him the best qualified man to operate the system, and not infrequently does he become the manager of the project. For these reasons it is important that a treatise on irrigation engineering be preceded by an introductory part on the use of irrigation water and irrigation practice.

Mr. Wilson's familiarity with those works, based largely on personal contact with them and their builders and operators, gave the early editions of his work a special value as contributions to western knowledge of this subject.The subsequent activity in irrigation in other parts of the world, especially in the United States, together with similar developments in related lines of municipal water supply and hydro-electric construction, have presented new problems and evolved new solutions of old ones to such an extent that what might almost be called a new science has been developed, requiring different treatment. Moreover, social, political and ewe nomic conditions in America are radically different from those in the Orient, and this imposes very different conditions and limitations upon the practice of irrigation engineering.

                    The new edition of Garber and Hoel's best-selling text focuses on giving students insight into all facets of traffic and highway engineering. Students generally come to this course with little knowledge or understanding of the importance of transportation, much less of the extensive career opportunities within the field. Transportation is an extremely broad field, and courses must either cover all transportation modes or focus on specifics. While many topics can be covered with a survey approach, this often lacks sufficient depth and students leave the course without a full understanding of any of the fields. This text focuses exclusively on traffic and highway engineering beginning with a discussion of the pivotal role transportation plays in our society, including employment opportunities, historical impact, and the impact of transportation on our daily lives. This approach gives students a sense of what the field is about as well as an opportunity to consider some of its challenges. Later chapters focus on specific issues facing transportation engineers. The text uses pedagogical tools such as worked problems, diagrams and tables, reference material, and realistic examples to demonstrate how the material is applied.

                    Principles of Applied Civil Engineering Design: Producing Drawings, Specifications, and Cost Estimates for Heavy Civil Projectswalks engineers through standard practice and basic principles needed to prepare quality design and construction documents for a successful infrastructure project. Drawing on more than 30 years of engineering and design experience, Ying-Kit Choi helps readers understand the interrelationships among contract documents, site characterization, design and construction documents, and construction cost estimates.Choi introduces the fundamentals and process of applied engineering design, including the necessary field investigations to characterize a project site. He provides pragmatic guidance on the ""how-to"" of producing construction drawings, with advice on graphical representation; legends, abbreviations, and notes; drawing techniques and software; and certification of construction drawings. He offers a wealth of details on developing technical specifications, including good writing practices, types of construction specifications, the standardized Construction Specifications Institute format, measurement and payment provisions, and reference data. Chapters on cost estimating cover quantity estimates, pricing estimates, allowances and contingencies, and bid evaluation. A handy glossary defines common terms.This second edition reflects the rapid changes in the methods and tools used to produce design drawings, updating the discussions of presentation formats and technical resources. Of particular interest, the 2014 Construction Specifications Institute format is introduced for use in preparing specifications and estimating construction costs. Nine chapters encourage readers to test their comprehension with example problems and solutions.By setting out the guidelines, principles, and philosophy needed to produce design and construction documents for heavy civil projects, Choi assembles an excellent introduction for civil engineering students and young professionals, as well as provides a valuable reference for experienced design engineers, contractors, and project owners.

                    Although technology and productivity has changed much of engineering, many topics are still taught in very similarly to how they were taught in the 70s. Using a new approach to engineering economics, Systems Life Cycle Costing: Economic Analysis, Estimation, and Management presents the material that a modern engineer must understand to work as a practicing engineer conducting economic analysis.   Organized around a product development process that provides a framework for the material, the book presents techniques such as engineering economics and simulation-based costing (SBC), with a focus on total life cycle understanding and perspective and introduces techniques for detailed analysis of modern complex systems. The author includes rules of thumb for estimation grouped with the methods, processes, and tools (MPTs) for conducting a detailed engineering buildup for costing. He presents the estimating costing of complex systems and software and then explores concepts such as design to cost (DTC), cost as an independent variable (CAIV), the role of commercial off-the-shelf technology, cost of quality, and the role of project management in LCC management.  No product or services are immune from cost, performance, schedule, quality, risks, and tradeoffs. Yet engineers spend most of their formal education focused on performance and most of their professional careers worrying about resources and schedule. Too often, the design stage becomes about the technical performance without considering the downstream costs that contribute to the tota1 life cycle costs (LCC) of a system. This text presents the methods, processes, and tools needed for the economic analysis, estimation, and management that bring these costs in line with the goals of pleasing the customer and staying within budget.

                    The book differs from other introduction to mathematical methods
at this level in several important areas.
First, it does not follow the usual presentation of a description of
the theory followed by examples and exercises. Rather we use examples
to introduce the theory. This approach is not new; it goes back
to the methods by which the scribes of Ancient Babylon learned
mathematics: by example problems and, to judge from the numbers
of surviving cuneiform tablets, lots of them!
Second, to help the reader digest the text, it is broken up into
quite short sections (often a page or so) followed by exercises. It may
be tempting to skip the exercises, (especially if one is used to doing
only a selection of “end-of-chapter” problems) on the grounds that
one can get through the book more quickly that way. This is true, in
the same sense that watching a film speeded up x8 will get to the end
more quickly, but it will be without much understanding of the plot.
There are optional additional exercises at the end of each chapter;
the ones in the text represent the minimum we think you need.
Third, however, we have tried to avoid too many “plug-andchug”
exercises, that is, exercises which you solve by following the
text but substituting some different numbers (“pattern matching”).
These are useful to reinforce memory, but they are not very useful
to develop or test understanding. Rather, we have tried to make the
exercises diagnostic in the sense that they do test understanding,
that is, they test the ability to use what has been learned in a slightly
different context. An instructor can therefore use these to target
support for students.

Finally, and related to the previous point, while we hope it is perfectly possible to use this book for self-study, it was not designed for that purpose. It is intended for use as a course text. In this regard it might be useful to say a little about the background to the writing of the book - especially if you are intrigued to know why there are so many authors. We would also like to thank contributions to various versions of the text from Paul Abel, Mike Dampier, Andrew King, and Tim Yeoman.
About forty years ago, it was agreed that our conventional
presentation of mathematical methods for our physics students -
lectures, marked homework,and examinations - was not as effective as we might have hoped. So, instead of spending lecture time going through theory and exercises on the board, we produced a text as, in effect, the lecture notes, and refocused class time on weekly workshops and small group tutorials. Lectures were restricted to a weekly one-hour introduction to the topics for that week. We made the examinations harder, by requiring passes separately in the major topics
(calculus of one variable, many variables, linear algebra, differential equations, vector calculus) and the pass rates soared. The initial text has been refined over the years (hence the number of authors) and this book is another, more outward-facing version, which we are pleased to have the opportunity to share with you.

Topical coverage includes: vector spaces, signals, and images; the discrete Fourier transform; the discrete cosine transform; convolution and filtering; windowing and localization; spectrograms; frames; filter banks; lifting schemes; and wavelets. Discrete Fourier Analysis and Wavelets introduces a new chapter on frames—a new technology in which signals, images, and other data are redundantly measured. This redundancy allows for more sophisticated signal analysis. The new coverage also expands upon the discussion on spectrograms using a frames approach. In addition, the book includes a new chapter on lifting schemes for wavelets and provides a variation on the original low-pass/high-pass filter bank approach to the design and implementation of wavelets. These new chapters also include appropriate exercises and MATLAB® projects for further experimentation and practice. • Features updated and revised content throughout, continues to emphasize discreteand digital methods, and utilizes MATLAB® to illustrate these concepts • Contains two new chapters on frames and lifting schemes, which take into account crucial new advances in the field of signal and image processing • Expands the discussion on spectrograms using a frames approach, which is an ideal method for reconstructing signals after information has been lost or corrupted (packet erasure) • Maintains a comprehensive treatment of linear signal processing for audio and image signals with a well-balanced and accessible selection of topics that appeal to a diverse audience within mathematics and engineering • Focuses on the underlying mathematics, especially the concepts of finite-dimensional vector spaces and matrix methods, and provides a rigorous model for signals and images based on vector spaces and linear algebra methods • Supplemented with a companion website containing solution sets and software exploration support for MATLAB and SciPy (Scientific Python) Thoroughly class-tested over the past fifteen years, Discrete Fourier Analysis and Wavelets: Applications to Signal and Image Processing is an appropriately self-contained book ideal for a one-semester course on the subject.S.

                    Mathematics is the science of patterns, and mathematicians attempt to understand these patterns and discover new ones using a variety of tools. In Proofs That Really Count, award-winning math professors Arthur Benjamin and Jennifer Quinn demonstrate that many number patterns, even very complex ones, can be understood by simple counting arguments. The book emphasizes numbers that are often not thought of as numbers that count: Fibonacci Numbers, Lucas Numbers, Continued Fractions, and Harmonic Numbers, to name a few. Numerous hints and references are given for all chapter exercises and many chapters end with a list of identities in need of combinatorial proof. The extensive appendix of identities will be a valuable resource. This book should appeal to readers of all levels, from high school math students to professional mathematicians.

                    For over thirty years, Stan Amos has provided students and practitioners with a text they could rely on to keep them at the forefront of transistor circuit design. This seminal work has now been presented in a clear new format and completely updated to include the latest equipment such as laser diodes, Trapatt diodes, optocouplers and GaAs transistors, and the most recent line output stages and switch-mode power supplies. Although integrated circuits have widespread application, the role of discrete transistors is undiminished, both as important building blocks which students must understand and as practical solutions to design problems, especially where appreciable power output or high voltage is required.  New circuit techniques covered for the first time in this edition include current-dumping amplifiers, bridge output stages, dielectric resonator oscillators, crowbar protection circuits, thyristor field timebases, low-noise blocks and SHF amplifiers in satellite receivers, video clamps, picture enhancement circuits, motor drive circuits in video recorders and camcorders, and UHF modulators. The plan of the book remains the same: semiconductor physics is introduced, followed by details of the design of transistors, amplifiers, receivers, oscillators and generators. Appendices provide information on transistor manufacture and parameters, and a new appendix on transistor letter symbols has been included                ",https://1lib.in/dl/2280255/329088,397,Newnes,1994,english,"PDF, 5.95 MB"

Since the previous edition was published in 1981 the use of integrated circuits has become even more widespread and miniaturisation has reached the point where half a million components can be accommodated on a single silicon chip. In radio and television receivers and video recorders, for example, most of the functions are carried out by integrated circuits. Nevertheless there is still a role for discrete transistors, particularly where appreciable power output for high-voltage operation is required. There are, for example, 30 in a 1989 model colour television receiver and considerably more in a video recorder. Discrete transistors are also likely to be used in experimental work and in the early stages of design of electronic equipment.

Digital signal processing (DSP) has been applied to a very wide range of applications. This includes voice processing, image processing, digital communications, the transfer of data over the internet, image and data compression, etc. Engineers who develop DSP applications today, and in the future, will need to address many implementation issues including mapping algorithms to computational structures, computational efficiency, power dissipation, the effects of finite precision arithmetic, throughput and hardware implementation. It is not practical to cover all of these in a single text. However, this text emphasizes the practical implementation of DSP algorithms as well as the fundamental theories and analytical procedures that form the basis for modern DSP applications.Digital Signal Processing: Principles, Algorithms and System Designprovides an introduction to the principals of digital signal processing along with a balanced analytical and practical treatment of algorithms and applications for digital signal processing. It is intended to serve as a suitable text for a one semester junior or senior level undergraduate course. It is also intended for use in a following one semester first-year graduate level course in digital signal processing.

                    In today’s digital design environment, engineers must achieve quick turn-around time with ready accesses to circuit synthesis and simulation applications. This type of productivity relies on the principles and practices of computer aided design (CAD). Digital Design: Basic Concepts and Principles addresses the many challenging issues critical to today’s digital design practices such as hazards and logic minimization, finite-state-machine synthesis, cycles and races, and testability theories while providing hands-on experience using one of the industry’s most popular design application, Xilinx Web PACK™. The authors begin by discussing conventional and unconventional number systems, binary coding theories, and arithmetic as well as logic functions and Boolean algebra.  Building upon classic theories of digital systems, the book illustrates the importance of logic minimization using the Karnaugh map technique. It continues by discussing implementation options and examining the pros and cons of each method in addition to an assessment of tradeoffs that often accompany design practices.  The book also covers testability, emphasizing that a good digital design must be easy to verify and test with the lowest cost possible. Throughout the text, the authors analyze combinational and sequential logic elements and illustrate the designs of these components in structural, hierarchical, and behavior VHDL descriptions. Coveringfundamentals and best practices, Digital Design: Basic Concepts and Principles provides you with critical knowledge of how each digital component ties together to form a system and develops the skills you need to design and simulate these digital components using modern CAD software                ",https://1lib.in/dl/3418848/6763a8,504,CRC Press,2008,english,"PDF, 28.31 MB"

                    I'm in my early 60's and I'm now back in school studying electronics engineering.  This book was used in one of my first back to college classes in 38 years.  I don't remember much math, but was able to understand the concepts in this book.  Yes it's hard and condensed.  I would like to see an idiot's version of Boolean Algebra that holds your hand more, but this book and my Professor got me through.  Thanks Dr. Luca!  For the first time in my life I now have a basic understanding of how a microprocessor and other digital logic electronic circuits work.  Out of what I learned in this text, concepts were put into a patent application filed this summer.  This invention would not have been as profound without having studied from this book.  All from 1 semester of studying electronics engineering.  I have much to learn, including computer programming as used in this book, such as the HDL languages.  This book includes 3 versions of HDL's: ABEL, VHDL, and Verilog.  You can pick and choose.  We used VHDL in my class.  For electronics engineering students with math and programming experience, this book should be great.  When I first went to college, everyone used slide rules!  There were no personal computers.  You learned Fortran on a main frame and hoped you did not make a mistake and have a tractor drive printer turn your $50.00 box of perf paper into nonsense within a few minutes.  $50.00 was a lot of money to a poor student then.  The minimum wage was $1.25!   But I learned a lot as a beginner with this book.  Cool jokes in the book.  Had fun in digital and even designed a vacuum tube into a digital circuit.  I had to explain what a tube is to the lab instructor.  Several professors thought that was cool.  A senior professor, head of graduate electronics engineering, really lit up when I told him about the tube.  He said, when I was a graduate student, the faculty built a digital computer using tubes and I got to program it!  Had a great time!  For those interested, the tube was a directly heated, subminiature pentode with a filament voltage of 1.25 and a plate voltage of 15 volts.  It was stuck into a clock line just for a reason to be there. The circuit would quit without the tube. Fun!!  For fun, it would be neat to find out if John Wakerly knows what a tube is!                ",https://1lib.in/dl/737902/a02761,927,Prentice Hall,2000,english,"PDF, 8.08 MB"

                    Learning Object-Oriented Programming is an easy-to-follow guide full of hands-on examples of solutions to common problems with object-oriented code in Python, JavaScript, and C#. It starts by helping you to recognize objects from real-life scenarios and demonstrates that working with them makes it simpler to write code that is easy to understand and reuse. You will learn to protect and hide data with the data encapsulation features of Python, JavaScript, and C#.  You will explore how to maximize code reuse by writing code capable of working with objects of different types, and discover the advantage of duck typing in both Python and JavaScript, while you work with interfaces and generics in C#. With a fair understanding of interfaces, multiple inheritance, and composition, you will move on to refactor existing code and to organize your source for easy maintenance and extension.  Learning Object-Oriented Programming will help you to make better, stronger, and reusable code.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/2736938/f35133,280,Packt Publishing,2015,english,"PDF, 2.92 MB"

                    Book provides good basics for people wanted to know it in simple words and samples. But it has some problems with terms definition. I was really confused by the definition of termEncapsulation - is a technique of linking together attributes and procedures to form an object. IT IS TERRIBLE MISTAKE, Booch and other says it is about another thing: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_science).Encapsulation is the hiding of the internal mechanisms and data structures of a software component behind a defined interface, in such a way that users of the component (other pieces of software) only need to know what the component does, and cannot make themselves dependent on the details of how it does it.  Book provides Sensible view on real-world problems of OOP implementation, this is really cool, I have many doubts why my programs can't strictly follow OOP paradigm, and I found the answer - because OOP is not a silver bullet for real world applications development. Sometimes it brings overcomplexity which is hard to maintain. And which does not satisfy application's business goals. But mostly this book is lack of reasonable big samples, especially in Real-world modelling chapter.

                    Dashboards have become popular in recent years as uniquely powerful tools for communicating important information at a glance. Although dashboards are potentially powerful, this potential is rarely realized. The greatest display technology in the world won't solve this if you fail to use effective visual design. And if a dashboard fails to tell you precisely what you need to know in an instant, you'll never use it, even if it's filled with cute gauges, meters, and traffic lights. Don't let your investment in dashboard technology go to waste.  This book will teach you the visual design skills you need to create dashboards that communicate clearly, rapidly, and compellingly. Information Dashboard Design will explain how to:     Avoid the thirteen mistakes common to dashboard design  Provide viewers with the information they need quickly and clearly  Apply what we now know about visual perception to the visual presentation of information  Minimize distractions, cliches, and unnecessary embellishments that create confusion  Organize business information to support meaning and usability  Create an aesthetically pleasing viewing experience  Maintain consistency of design to provide accurate interpretation  Optimize the power of dashboard technology by pairing it with visual effectiveness     Stephen Few has over 20 years of experience as an IT innovator, consultant, and educator.

                    I wanted to compute 80th term of the Fibonacci series. I wrote the rampant recursive function, 

int fib(int n){ 

return (1==n || 2==n) ? 1 : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2); 

} 

and waited for the result. I wait… and wait… and wait… 

With an 8GB RAM and an Intel i5 CPU, why is it taking so long? I terminated the process and tried computing the 40th term. It took about a second. I put a check and was shocked to find that the above recursive function was called 204,668,309 times while computing the 40th term. 

More than 200 million times? Is it reporting function calls or scam of some government? 

The Dynamic Programming solution computes 100th Fibonacci term in less than fraction of a second, with a single function call, taking linear time and constant extra memory. 

A recursive solution, usually, neither pass all test cases in a coding competition, nor does it impress the interviewer in an interview of company like Google, Microsoft, etc.

                    This book (CS:APP3e) is the third edition of a book that stems from the introductory computer systems course we developed at Carnegie Mellon University, starting in the Fall of 1998, called ""Introduction to Computer Systems"" (ICS). The presentation is based on the following principles, which aim to help the students become better programmers and to help prepare them for upper-level systems courses: 
• Students should be introduced to computer systems from the perspective of a programmer, rather from the more traditional perspective of a system implementer. What does this mean? 
• Students should get a view of the complete system, comprising the hardware, operating system, compiler, and network. 
• Students learn best by developing and evaluating real programs that run on real machines. 
We cover data representations, machine level representations of C programs, processor architecture, program optimizations, the memory hierarchy, linking, exceptional control flow (exceptions, interrupts, processes, and Unix signals), virtual memory and memory management, system-level I/O, basic network programming, and concurrent programming. These concepts are supported by series of fun and hands-on lab assignments. See the manuscript Preface for more details.

                    The award-winning and highly influential Software Architecture in Practice, Third Edition, has been substantially revised to reflect the latest developments in the field. In a real-world setting, the book once again introduces the concepts and best practices of software architecture—how a software system is structured and how that system’s elements are meant to interact. Distinct from the details of implementation, algorithm, and data representation, an architecture holds the key to achieving system quality, is a reusable asset that can be applied to subsequent systems, and is crucial to a software organization’s business strategy.
The authors have structured this edition around the concept of architecture influence cycles. Each cycle shows how architecture influences, and is influenced by, a particular context in which architecture plays a critical role. Contexts include technical environment, the life cycle of a project, an organization’s business profile, and the architect’s professional practices. The authors also have greatly expanded their treatment of quality attributes, which remain central to their architecture philosophy—with an entire chapter devoted to each attribute—and broadened their treatment of architectural patterns.
If you design, develop, or manage large software systems (or plan to do so), you will find this book to be a valuable resource for getting up to speed on the state of the art.
Totally new material covers:
• Contexts of software architecture: technical, project, business, and professional
• Architecture competence: what this means both for individuals and organizations
• The origins of business goals and how this affects architecture
• Architecturally significant requirements, and how to determine them
• Architecture in the life cycle, including generate-and-test as a design philosophy; architecture conformance during implementation; architecture and testing; and architecture and agile development

The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles,Noam Nisan,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/a5/db/b5/a5dbb5e7ffbde42b362c27289594f473.jpg,"
A textbook with a hands-on approach that leads students through the gradual construction of a complete and working computer system including the hardware platform and the software hierarchy.In the early days of computer science, the interactions of hardware, software, compilers, and operating system were simple enough to allow students to see an overall picture of how computers worked. With the increasing complexity of computer technology and the resulting specialization of knowledge, such clarity is often lost. Unlike other texts that cover only one aspect of the field, The Elements of Computing Systems gives students an integrated and rigorous picture of applied computer science, as it comes to play in the construction of a simple yet powerful computer system.  Indeed, the best way to understand how computers work is to build one from scratch, and this textbook leads students through twelve chapters and projects that gradually build a basic hardware platform and a modern software hierarchy from the ground up. In the process, the students gain hands-on knowledge of hardware architecture, operating systems, programming languages, compilers, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. Using this constructive approach, the book exposes a significant body of computer science knowledge and demonstrates how theoretical and applied techniques taught in other courses fit into the overall picture.  Designed to support one- or two-semester courses, the book is based on an abstraction-implementation paradigm; each chapter presents a key hardware or software abstraction, a proposed implementation that makes it concrete, and an actual project. The emerging computer system can be built by following the chapters, although this is only one option, since the projects are self-contained and can be done or skipped in any order. All the computer science knowledge necessary for completing the projects is embedded in the book, the only pre-requisite being a programming experience.The book's web site provides all tools and materials necessary to build all the hardware and software systems described in the text, including two hundred test programs for the twelve projects. The projects and systems can be modified to meet various teaching needs, and all the supplied software is open-source.

API Architecture - The Big Picture for Building APIs,Matthias Biehl,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/bb/70/47/bb7047b8073f3697ea1bab047fa211f3.jpg,"
                    Looking for the big picture of building APIs? This book is for you! Building APIs that consumers love should certainly be the goal of any API initiative. However, it is easier said than done. It requires getting the architecture for your APIs right. This book equips you with both foundations and best practices for API architecture. This book is for you if you want to understand the big picture of API design and development, you want to define an API architecture, establish a platform for APIs or simply want to build APIs your consumers love. This book is NOT for you, if you are looking for a step-by step guide for building APIs, focusing on every detail of the correct application of REST principles. In this case I recommend the book ""API Design"" of the API-University Series. What is API architecture? Architecture spans the bigger picture of APIs and can be seen from several perspectives:

    API architecture may refer to the architecture of the complete solution consisting not only of the API itself, but also of an API client such as a mobile app and several other components. API solution architecture explains the components and their relations within the software solution.
    API architecture may refer to the technical architecture of the API platform. When building, running and exposing not only one, but several APIs, it becomes clear that certain building blocks of the API, runtime functionality and management functionality for the API need to be used over and over again. An API platform provides an infrastructure for developing, running and managing APIs.
    API architecture may refer to the architecture of the API portfolio. The API portfolio contains all APIs of the enterprise and needs to be managed like a product. API portfolio architecture analyzes the functionality of the API and organizes, manages and reuses the APIs.
    API architecture may refer to the design decisions for a particular API proxy. To document the design decisions, API description languages are used. We explain the use of API description languages (RAML and Swagger) on many examples.

This book covers all of the above perspectives on API architecture. However, to become useful, the architecture needs to be put into practice. This is why this book covers an API methodology for design and development. An API methodology provides practical guidelines for putting API architecture into practice. It explains how to develop an API architecture into an API that consumers love. A lot of the information on APIs is available on the web. Most of it is published by vendors of API products. I am always a bit suspicious of technical information pushed by product vendors. This book is different. In this book, a product-independent view on API architecture is presented. The API-University Series is a modular series of books on API-related topics.

                    Apress, 2010 by Rytis SileikaThe scope of the system administrator role has changed dramatically over the years. The number of systems supported by a single engineer has also increased. As such, it is impractical to handcraft each installation, and there is a need to automate as many tasks as possible. The structure of systems varies from organization to organization, therefore system administrators must be able to create their own management tools. Historically, the most popular programming languages for these tasks were UNIX shell and Perl. They served their purpose well, and I doubt they will ever cease to exist. However, the complexity of current systems requires new tools, and the Python programming language is one of them. Python is an object oriented programming language suitable for developing large-scale applications. Its syntax and structure make is very easy to read, so much so that the language is sometimes referred to as executable pseudocode. The Python interpreter allows for interactive execution, so in some situations, you can use it instead of a standard UNIX shell. Although Python is primarily an object-oriented language, you can easily adopt it for procedural and functional styles of programming. Given all that, Python makes a perfect fit as a new language for implementing system administration applications. There are a large number of Linux system utilities already written in Python, such as the Yum package manager and Anaconda, the Linux installation program.This book is about using the Python programming language to solve specific system administration tasks. We will look at the four distinctive system administration areas: network management, web server and web application management, database system management, and system monitoring. Although I will explain most of the technologies used in this book in detail, bear in mind that the main goal of this book is to show you the practical application of the Python libraries to solve rather specific issues. Therefore, I’m assuming that you are a seasoned system administrator. As we go along with the examples, you will be asked to install additional packages and libraries. In most cases, I provide the commands and instructions to perform these tasks on a Fedora system, but you should be ready to adopt these instructions to the Linux distribution that you are going to use. Most of the examples work without many modifications on a recent OS X release (10.6.X) too. I also assume that you have a background in the Python programming language. I will be focusing on introducing the specific libraries that are used in system administration tasks as well as some lesser known or less-often-discussed language functionality, such as the generator functions or the class internal methods, but the basic language syntax is not explained. If you want to refresh your Python skills I would recommend Beginning Python: From Novice to Professional, Second Edition by Magnus Lie Hetland (Apress, 2008). All examples presented in this book assume the Python version 2.6 and will not work correctly with the latest Python 3 without additional modifications. Most of the examples rely on additional modules that have not yet been ported to this version of Python.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/2998376/075b4d,,,,english,"PDF, 7.08 MB"

Spatial Databases: With Application to GIS (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems),Philippe Rigaux,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/9f/cc/18/9fcc186b22572563ab5cbcc7f17a7660.jpg,"
                    This textbook is an excellent resource for people specifically interested in the theoretical nuts and bolts of spatial databases. The book covers a lot of ground in just over 400 pages. It would be an excellent text for an advanced GIS programming course for either geography students or computer science students. For the geography student, the text provides an excellent coverage of database concepts while drawing on familiar topics. For the computer science student, the book extends basic knowledge of DBMS for spatial applications. The book is divided into eight chapters. Each chapter is completed with an excellent bibliographical review of relevant publications. This review, alone, is worth the price of the book. Chapter 1: Introduction to Spatial Database: Covers basic concepts of SQL, DBMS and spatial data. Chapter 2: Representation of Spatial Objects: This chapter should be familiar to anyone with a GIS background but would fill in the gaps for computer science students. The section on formats and standards is a bit dated but provides a nice theoretical background - especially for the Census TIGER data. Chapter 3: Logical Models and Query Languages: Opposite of Chapter 2, this chapter will challenge the Geography student while further grounding the Computer Science student in GIS data types. Chapter 4: The Constraint Data Model: Here the authors choose to introduce some unique material in the form of the constraint data model. The model is designed specifically to encode spatial data in a basic relational model. The chapter even breaks down the model into relational algebra statements. For most teaching purposes, this chapter can be skipped. Chapter 5: Computational Geometry: An odd gem in a text on spatial databases. This chapter provides a basic introduction to computation geometry techniques and their application to spatial data. One of the most significant aspects of a spatial databases is that it encodes geometric representations of geographic phenomena. Basic computational geometry is a necessary extension for a database to truly support spatial data. Pseudo-code is given but I would recommend the classic Computational Geometry in C (Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science) for detailed implementations. This chapter will be challenging for Geography students but simple for Computer Science students. Chapter 6: Spatial Access Methods: The biggest challenge for spatial databases is spatial indexing - adding a true sense of ""where"" to SELECT...WHERE! The chapter focuses mostly on classical index structures - B-tree, R-Tree, etc. This would be a good chapter for a ""short week"" as it is either a research focus or matter of ""it just works"". Students who desire to research spatial indexing will find the chapter lacking. Others will find it overwhelming. Chapter 7: Query Processing: Like Chapter 6, this chapter delves into details that only a student truly interested in researching spatial indexes or developing new databases would be concerned with. The chapter presents how the spatial index is utilized for joins and relates. Chapter 8: Commercial Systems: Any book that attempts to survey existing software is always out of date. This chapter might be of historical interest but is hardly worth covering. The section of PostgreSQL is interesting but better material exists on the web. Overall, the book is well written and clearly presents the material. The coverage is focused on applications to spatial databases. My favorite advanced GIS textbook is GIS: A Computing Perspective, Second Edition.

Do you need an introductory book on data and databases? If the book is by Joe Celko, the answer is yes. Data and Databases: Concepts in Practice is the first introduction to relational database technology written especially for practicing IT professionals. If you work mostly outside the database world, this book will ground you in the concepts and overall framework you must master if your data-intensive projects are to be successful. If you're already an experienced database programmer, administrator, analyst, or user, it will let you take a step back from your work and examine the founding principles on which you rely every day-helping you to work smarter, faster, and problem-free.
Whatever your field or level of expertise, Data and Databases offers you the depth and breadth of vision for which Celko is famous. No one knows the topic as well as he, and no one conveys this knowledge as clearly, as effectively-or as engagingly. Filled with absorbing war stories and no-holds-barred commentary, this is a book you'll pick up again and again, both for the information it holds and for the distinctive style that marks it as genuine Celko.

In this text, Terry goes thru great efforts to promote the use of object role modeling, ORM, in conceptual designs. I am somewhat sceptical about why there no other book or author using ORM in their explanations of conceptual designs. I whish I had $5k to purchase a copy of ERwin so I could be in the main stream.
I also contacted Microsoft and asked if they were enhancing Visio for Enterprise Architects in Visual Studio 2005. They told me that it will still ship with it but that there are no changes to accommodate SQL Server 2005.

Networks play a central role in today’s society, since many sectors employing information technology, such as communication, mobility, and transport - even social interactions and political activities - are based on and rely on networks. In these times of globalization and the current global financial crisis with its complex and nearly incomprehensible entanglements of various structures and its huge effect on seemingly unrelated institutions and organizations, the need to understand large networks, their complex structures, and the processes governing them is becoming more and more important.This state-of-the-art survey reports on the progress made in selected areas of this important and growing field, thus helping to analyze existing large and complex networks and to design new and more efficient algorithms for solving various problems on these networks since many of them have become so large and complex that classical algorithms are not sufficient anymore. This volume emerged from a research program funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) consisting of projects focusing on the design of new discrete algorithms for large and complex networks. The 18 papers included in the volume present the results of projects realized within the program and survey related work. They have been grouped into four parts: network algorithms, traffic networks, communication networks, and network analysis and simulation.

                    Randomness is a powerful phenomenon that can be harnessed to solve various problems in all areas of computer science. Randomized algorithms are often more efficient, simpler and, surprisingly, also more reliable than their deterministic counterparts. Computing tasks exist that require billions of years of computer work when solved using the fastest known deterministic algorithms, but they can be solved using randomized algorithms in a few minutes with negligible error probabilities.

Introducing the fascinating world of randomness, this book systematically teaches the main algorithm design paradigms – foiling an adversary, abundance of witnesses, fingerprinting, amplification, and random sampling, etc. – while also providing a deep insight into the nature of success in randomization. Taking sufficient time to present motivations and to develop the reader's intuition, while being rigorous throughout, this text is a very effective and efficient introduction to this exciting field.

                    Unlike some operating systems, Linux doesn’t try to hide the important bits from you—it gives you full control of your computer. But to truly master Linux, you need to understand its internals, like how the system boots, how networking works, and what the kernel actually does.

In this completely revised second edition of the perennial best seller How Linux Works, author Brian Ward makes the concepts behind Linux internals accessible to anyone curious about the inner workings of the operating system. Inside, you’ll find the kind of knowledge that normally comes from years of experience doing things the hard way.

You’ll learn:
• How Linux boots, from boot loaders to init implementations (systemd, Upstart, and System V)
• How the kernel manages devices, device drivers, and processes
• How networking, interfaces, firewalls, and servers work
• How development tools work and relate to shared libraries
• How to write effective shell scripts

You’ll also explore the kernel and examine key system tasks inside user space, including system calls, input and output, and filesystems. With its combination of background, theory, real-world examples, and patient explanations, How Linux Works will teach you what you need to know to solve pesky problems and take control of your operating system.

You'll build a RESTful microservice with Python and learn how to encapsulate the code for the services into a container using Docker. While developing the services, you'll understand how to use tools such as GitHub and Travis CI to ensure continuous delivery (CD) and continuous integration (CI). As the systems become complex and grow in size, you'll be introduced to Kubernetes and explore how to orchestrate a system of containers while managing multiple services. Next, you'll configure Kubernetes clusters for production-ready environments and secure them for reliable deployments. In the concluding chapters, you'll learn how to detect and debug critical problems with the help of logs and metrics. Finally, you'll discover a variety of strategies for working with multiple teams dealing with different microservices for effective collaboration.
By the end of this book, you'll be able to build production-grade microservices as well as orchestrate a complex system of services using containers.

What you will learn
• Discover how to design, test, and operate scalable microservices
• Coordinate and deploy different services using Kubernetes
• Use Docker to construct scalable and manageable applications with microservices
• Understand how to monitor a complete system to ensure early detection of problems
• Become well versed with migrating from an existing monolithic system to a microservice one
• Use load balancing to ensure seamless operation between the old monolith and the new service

 Software Engineering at Google,Hyrum Wright,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/03/2e/e6/032ee62576302e880c39607600b19582.png,"
How do you manage a living codebase that evolves and responds to changing requirements and demands over the length of its life? Based on their experience at Google, software engineers Titus Winters and Hyrum K. Wright, along with technical writer Tom Manshreck, present a candid and insightful look at how some of the world’s leading practitioners construct and maintain software.
At Google, software engineering represents roughly 80-90% of the work, while only 10-20% of the time involves original programming. Most teaching on this subject concentrates on programming, but little on software engineering. By emphasizing three fundamental principles that software organizations should keep in mind when designing, architecting, and writing code, this book explains:
  * Fundamental differences between software engineering and programming
  * The software engineering lifecycle from code development to testing to deprecation
  * How to effectively manage your codebase and efficiently respond to change
  * Why culture is important, and how processes, practices, and tools come into play
  * Tradeoffs: how an organization makes optimal software decisions by keeping time and scale in mind

Book Description
Software Engineering is about more than just writing code―it includes a host of soft skills that apply to almost any development effort, no matter what the language, development methodology, or scope of the project. Being a senior developer all but requires awareness of how those skills, along with their expected technical counterparts, mesh together through a project's life cycle. This book walks you through that discovery by going over the entire life cycle of a multi-tier system and its related software projects. You'll see what happens before any development takes place, and what impact the decisions and designs made at each step have on the development process. The development of the entire project, over the course of several iterations based on real-world Agile iterations, will be executed, sometimes starting from nothing, in one of the fastest growing languages in the world―Python. Application of practices in Python will be laid out, along with a number of Python-specific capabilities that are often overlooked. Finally, the book will implement a high-performance computing solution, from first principles through complete foundation.

What you will learn
• Understand what happens over the course of a system's life (SDLC)
• Establish what to expect from the pre-development life cycle steps
• Find out how the development-specific phases of the SDLC affect development
• Uncover what a real-world development process might be like, in an Agile way
• Find out how to do more than just write the code
• Identify the existence of project-independent best practices and how to use them
• Find out how to design and implement a high-performance computing process

Software Engineering: Architecture-driven Software Development is the first comprehensive guide to the underlying skills embodied in the IEEE's Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) standard. Standards expert Richard Schmidt explains the traditional software engineering practices recognized for developing projects for government or corporate systems.  Software engineering education often lacks standardization, with many institutions focusing on implementation rather than design as it impacts product architecture. Many graduates join the workforce with incomplete skills, leading to software projects that either fail outright or run woefully over budget and behind schedule.  Additionally, software engineers need to understand system engineering and architecture-the hardware and peripherals their programs will run on. This issue will only grow in importance as more programs leverage parallel computing, requiring an understanding of the parallel capabilities of processors and hardware. This book gives both software developers and system engineers key insights into how their skillsets support and complement each other. With a focus on these key knowledge areas, Software Engineering offers a set of best practices that can be applied to any industry or domain involved in developing software products.A thorough, integrated compilation on the engineering of software products, addressing the majority of the standard knowledge areas and topics Offers best practices focused on those key skills common to many industries and domains that develop software Learn how software engineering relates to systems engineering for better communication with other engineering professionals within a project environment ",https://1lib.in/dl/2190533/646279,376,Morgan Kaufmann,2013,english,"PDF, 11.97 MB"

Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe,Edgar Allan Poe,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/30/d3/b1/30d3b1ee1a09650089ea91afaba4cd8e.jpg,"
                    I am forced here to eco the thoughts and feelings of several other reviewers here, ""what can you say? It's Poe.""  To do  a critical analysis of this work, in particular by a non-Poe scholar such is myself, would be the height of arrogance on my part; pontificating on a subject of which so many, many others are more qualified would come across as, well...pompous and in many ways laughable.  I seriously doubt if I could come up with bits of criticism or accolades others have not been hammering away at for the past one hundred years or so.   Poe though is one of my favorite short story authors and indeed, one of my favorite poets.  I have been reading him for well over fifty years now and his work is as bright and fresh to me now as when it was first read to me as a child.  There are a few things to note though, and a couple of comments the reader needs to be aware of concerning this particular edition. First, this work has not been annotated nor has it been translated (French).  I note that on this site and several others that this has thrown some into a hissy fit state.  Good grief!  This lack of translation does not distract from the story a bit.  In addition, with the most simplest of computers it only takes a snap or two on the mouse to come up with the translation of not only French, but just about any other language  you might come across...stop being so lazy!  Having to research it yourself is the best way to learn!  If you have problems understanding what he is writing of; again, there are literally thousands of sites that would love a visit from you...many of them are quite good! No computer?  Not problem!  They actually have books at your local library with the same information in them! Secondly, I have noted that on this site and several others that there seems to be a bit of whining about Poe's vocabulary, i.e. he uses ""big words.""  Folks, if you read 90 percent of the popular fiction books being cranked out today and pay very, very close attention, you will find that they have been dumbed down.  They are ALL written at a 7th or 8th grade level!  If you must use a dictionary a bit (which I fully and proudly admit to being forced to use each time I read Poe), then so much the better!  Learning a new word and its usage is actually a good thing! I promise you that you will not suffer any permanent physical or mental damage.  Thirdly, I note that on this site and several others it has been mentioned, and again whine about the fact that Poe tends to use a prose style that is no longer is use.  Good grief.  I suppose we should have his entire works purged of such and bring it all up to date...Hey Reader's Digest...you are falling down on the job! You are missing out on the chance to befoul yet another masterful bit of writing!  This of all the complaints has to be the most asinine. I almost have to cry when I read such gibberish, yet at the same time feel a certain degree of pity for those that make such statements.  Fourthly, it should be noted that Poe is actually the Great Grand Daddy of the detective novel or short story and was at least a generation ahead of Doyle.  There are some great detective stories in his body of work and should not be missed my any lover of this genre. Fifthly, it may come as a shock to some, but Poe did write more than just ""The Raven."" If you have not read Poe...you should.  If it has been years since you visited him...get off your duff and set down with a cup of tea, and your pipe, if so inclined to participate in that nasty habit, and do some rediscovering.  If you are in school, i.e. of the younger set, read him.  I promise you will learn much of writing, story telling, emotions and actually yourself.   Do yourself a big time favor and get a copy of this particular edition, or any other edition for that matter, and get reacquainted with this genius. Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks                ",https://1lib.in/dl/647095/2e0900,1057,Doubleday,1966,english,"PDF, 4.39 MB"

                    This book provides practicing scientists and engineers a tutorial on the fundamental concepts and use of microcontrollers. Today, microcontrollers, or single integrated circuit (chip) computers, play critical roles in almost all instrumentation and control systems. Most existing books arewritten for undergraduate and graduate students taking an electrical and/or computer engineering course. Furthermore, these texts have beenwritten with a particular model of microcontroller as the target discussion. These textbooks also require a requisite knowledge of digital design fundamentals. This textbook presents the fundamental concepts common to all microcontrollers. Our goals are to present the over–arching theory of microcontroller operation and to provide a detailed discussion on constituent subsystems available in most microcontrollers. With such goals, we envision that the theory discussed in this book can be readily applied to a wide variety of microcontroller technologies, allowing practicing scientists and engineers to become acquainted with basic concepts prior to beginning a design involving a specific microcontroller. We have found that the fundamental principles of a given microcontroller are easily transferred to other controllers.

What Can Be Computed?: A Practical Guide to the Theory of Computation,John MacCormick,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/7b/9c/51/7b9c51fe0080fe233189df1a9fdbe717.jpg,"
                    An accessible and rigorous textbook for introducing undergraduates to computer science theory

What Can Be Computed? is a uniquely accessible yet rigorous introduction to the most profound ideas at the heart of computer science. Crafted specifically for undergraduates who are studying the subject for the first time, and requiring minimal prerequisites, the book focuses on the essential fundamentals of computer science theory and features a practical approach that uses real computer programs (Python and Java) and encourages active experimentation. It is also ideal for self-study and reference.

The book covers the standard topics in the theory of computation, including Turing machines and finite automata, universal computation, nondeterminism, Turing and Karp reductions, undecidability, time-complexity classes such as P and NP, and NP-completeness, including the Cook-Levin Theorem. But the book also provides a broader view of computer science and its historical development, with discussions of Turing's original 1936 computing machines, the connections between undecidability and Gödel's incompleteness theorem, and Karp's famous set of twenty-one NP-complete problems.

Throughout, the book recasts traditional computer science concepts by considering how computer programs are used to solve real problems. Standard theorems are stated and proven with full mathematical rigor, but motivation and understanding are enhanced by considering concrete implementations. The book's examples and other content allow readers to view demonstrations of―and to experiment with―a wide selection of the topics it covers. The result is an ideal text for an introduction to the theory of computation.

                    Financial Risk Forecasting is a complete introduction to practical quantitative risk management, with a focus on market risk. Derived from the authors teaching notes and years spent training practitioners in risk management techniques, it brings together the three key disciplines of finance, statistics and modeling (programming), to provide a thorough grounding in risk management techniques.Written by renowned risk expert Jon Danielsson, the book begins with an introduction to financial markets and market prices, volatility clusters, fat tails and nonlinear dependence. It then goes on to present volatility forecasting with both univatiate and multivatiate methods, discussing the various methods used by industry, with a special focus on the GARCH family of models. The evaluation of the quality of forecasts is discussed in detail. Next, the main concepts in risk and models to forecast risk are discussed, especially volatility, value-at-risk and expected shortfall. The focus is both on risk in basic assets such as stocks and foreign exchange, but also calculations of risk in bonds and options, with analytical methods such as delta-normal VaR and duration-normal VaR and Monte Carlo simulation. The book then moves on to the evaluation of risk models with methods like backtesting, followed by a discussion on stress testing. The book concludes by focussing on the forecasting of risk in very large and uncommon events with extreme value theory and considering the underlying assumptions behind almost every risk model in practical use – that risk is exogenous – and what happens when those assumptions are violated.Every method presented brings together theoretical discussion and derivation of key equations and a discussion of issues in practical implementation. Each method is implemented in both MATLAB and R, two of the most commonly used mathematical programming languages for risk forecasting with which the reader can implement the models illustrated in the book.The book includes four appendices. The first introduces basic concepts in statistics and financial time series referred to throughout the book. The second and third introduce R and MATLAB, providing a discussion of the basic implementation of the software packages. And the final looks at the concept of maximum likelihood, especially issues in implementation and testing.The book is accompanied by a website - www.financialriskforecasting.com – which features downloadable code as used in the book.

                    This book is intended to provide an account of those parts of contemporary set theory that are relevant to other areas of pure mathematics. Intended for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students, the text is written in an easy-going style, with a minimum of formalism. The book begins with a review of ""naive"" set theory; it then develops the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of the theory, showing how they arise naturally from a rigorous answer to the question, ""what is a set?"" After discussing the ordinal and cardinal numbers, the book then delves into contemporary set theory, covering such topics as: the Borel hierarchy, stationary sets and regressive functions, and Lebesgue measure. Two chapters present an extension of the Zermelo-Fraenkel theory, discussing the axiom of constructibility and the question of provability in set theory. A final chapter presents an account of an alternative conception of set theory that has proved useful in computer science, the non-well-founded set theory of Peter Aczel. The author is a well-known mathematician and the editor of the ""Computers in Mathematics"" column in the AMS Notices and of FOCUS, the magazine published by the MAA.

                    Covering the breadth of a large topic, this book provides a thorough grounding in object-oriented concepts, the software development process, UML and multi-tier technologies.   After covering some basic ground work underpinning OO software projects, the book follows the steps of a typical development project (Requirements Capture - Design - Specification & Test), showing how an abstract problem is taken through to a concrete solution. The book is programming language agnostic - so code is kept to a minimum to avoid detail and deviation into implementation minutiae.A single case study running through the text provides a realistic example showing development from an initial proposal through to a finished system. Key artifacts such as the requirements document and detailed designs are included. For each aspect of the case study, there is an exercise for the reader to produce similar documents for a different system.

Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) has over the years, become a vast field, encompassing such diverse topics as design process and principles, documentation tools, refactoring, and design and architectural patterns. For most students the learning experience is incomplete without implementation. This new textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to OOAD. The salient points of its coverage are: • A sound footing on object-oriented concepts such as classes, objects, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic linking, etc. • A good introduction to the stage of requirements analysis. • Use of UML to document user requirements and design. • An extensive treatment of the design process. • Coverage of implementation issues. • Appropriate use of design and architectural patterns. • Introduction to the art and craft of refactoring. • Pointers to resources that further the reader’s knowledge. All the main case-studies used for this book have been implemented by the authors using Java. The text is liberally peppered with snippets of code, which are short and fairly self-explanatory and easy to read. Familiarity with a Java-like syntax and a broad understanding of the structure of Java would be helpful in using the book to its full potential.

                    Tech-guru Brian McCullough delivers a rollicking history of the internet, why it exploded, and how it changed everything.

The internet was never intended for you, opines Brian McCullough in this lively narrative of an era that utterly transformed everything we thought we knew about technology. In How the Internet Happened, he chronicles the whole fascinating story for the first time, beginning in a dusty Illinois basement in 1993, when a group of college kids set off a once-in-an-epoch revolution with what would become the first “dotcom.”

Depicting the lives of now-famous innovators like Netscape’s Marc Andreessen and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, McCullough also reveals surprising quirks and unknown tales as he tracks both the technology and the culture around the internet’s rise. Cinematic in detail and unprecedented in scope, the result both enlightens and informs as it draws back the curtain on the new rhythm of disruption and innovation the internet fostered, and helps to redefine an era that changed every part of our lives.

THE NEW YORK TIMES, USA TODAY, AND WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLERDr. Kai-Fu Lee—one of the world’s most respected experts on AI and China—reveals that China has suddenly caught up to the US at an astonishingly rapid and unexpected pace.  In AI Superpowers, Kai-fu Lee argues powerfully that because of these unprecedented developments in AI, dramatic changes will be happening much sooner than many of us expected. Indeed, as the US-Sino AI competition begins to heat up, Lee urges the US and China to both accept and to embrace the great responsibilities that come with significant technological power. Most experts already say that AI will have a devastating impact on blue-collar jobs. But Lee predicts that Chinese and American AI will have a strong impact on white-collar jobs as well. Is universal basic income the solution? In Lee’s opinion, probably not.  But he provides  a clear description of which jobs will be affected and how soon, which jobs can be enhanced with AI, and most importantly, how we can provide solutions to some of the most profound changes in human history that are coming soon.

Science world luminary John Brockman assembles twenty-five of the most important scientific minds, people who have been thinking about the field artificial intelligence for most of their careers, for an unparalleled round-table examination about mind, thinking, intelligence and what it means to be human.""Artificial intelligence is today's story--the story behind all other stories. It is the Second Coming and the Apocalypse at the same time: Good AI versus evil AI.""--John BrockmanMore than sixty years ago, mathematician-philosopher Norbert Wiener published a book on the place of machines in society that ended with a warning: ""we shall never receive the right answers to our questions unless we ask the right questions.... The hour is very late, and the choice of good and evil knocks at our door.""In the wake of advances in unsupervised, self-improving machine learning, a small but influential community of thinkers is considering Wiener's words again. InPossible Minds, John Brockman gathers their disparate visions of where AI might be taking us.The fruit of the long history of Brockman's profound engagement with the most important scientific minds who have been thinking about AI--from Alison Gopnik and David Deutsch to Frank Wilczek and Stephen Wolfram--Possible Mindsis an ideal introduction to the landscape of crucial issues AI presents. The collision between opposing perspectives is salutary and exhilarating; some of these figures, such as computer scientist Stuart Russell, Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, and physicist Max Tegmark, are deeply concerned with the threat of AI, including the existential one, while others, notably robotics entrepreneur Rodney Brooks, philosopher Daniel Dennett, and bestselling author Steven Pinker, have a very different view.

On the Eve of the AI era, it is perfect timing to read an AI expert's autobiography, to learn about Dr. Kai-Fu Lee, the author of ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley & the New World,"". This is the first and only authorized English version of Dr. Lee's autobiography. The original Chinese version of the sold 1.2 million copies in China in 2009 as a best seller of the year over there. Evidently, this autobiography is full of spellbinding stories.A natural-born pioneer, Dr. Lee has explored uncharted territories and developed new fields in the high-tech world. In addition, his Chinese American background has enabled him to effectively bridge corporate America with the China market. He recounts all his career experiences with Apple, Microsoft, and Google as well as his own technological achievements in this amazing autobiography.Dr. Lee was once the focus of a media sensation in 2005 when Microsoft and Google fought over him in court. He shocked the media again in 2009 by resigning from the position of Google China's president. There have been many speculations about the two incidents, behind which some insider stories are exclusively told in this book.The autobiography depicts not only Dr. Lee but also several prominent high-tech leaders he has worked with in the past two decades. It gets up close and personal with Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, Eric Schmidt, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. It contains their anecdotes hardly ever known to the general public.

The AI Advantage: How to Put the Artificial Intelligence Revolution to Work,Thomas H. Davenport,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/1a/c4/fa/1ac4faaa797aa0ab5d2afdfc361d7841.jpg,"
                    In The AI Advantage, Thomas Davenport offers a guide to using artificial intelligence in business. He describes what technologies are available and how companies can use them for business benefits and competitive advantage. He cuts through the hype of the AI craze—remember when it seemed plausible that IBM’s Watson could cure cancer?—to explain how businesses can put artificial intelligence to work now, in the real world. His key recommendation: don’t go for the “moonshot” (curing cancer, or synthesizing all investment knowledge); look for the “low-hanging fruit” to make your company more efficient.
Davenport explains that the business value AI offers is solid rather than sexy or splashy. AI will improve products and processes and make decisions better informed—important but largely invisible tasks. AI technologies won’t replace human workers but augment their capabilities, with smart machines to work alongside smart people. AI can automate structured and repetitive work; provide extensive analysis of data through machine learning (“analytics on steroids”), and engage with customers and employees via chatbots and intelligent agents. Companies should experiment with these technologies and develop their own expertise.
Davenport describes the major AI technologies and explains how they are being used, reports on the AI work done by large commercial enterprises like Amazon  and Google, and outlines strategies and steps to becoming a cognitive corporation. This book provides an invaluable guide to the real-world future of business AI.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/3611127/8bf1ec,248,Mit Press,2018,english,"PDF, 7.63 MB"

By the end, you'll be able to build a quality, production-ready Xamarin app on iOS and Android from scratch with a high level of code reuse. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the Technology Rewriting the same app for iOS and Android is tedious, error-prone, and expensive. Microsoft's Xamarin drastically reduces dev time by reusing most application code—typically 70% or more. The core of your iOS and Android app is shared; you write platform-specific code only for the UI layer. And because Xamarin uses C#, your apps benefit from everything this modern language and the .NET ecosystem have to offer. About the Book Xamarin in Action teaches you to build cross-platform mobile apps using Xamarin and C#. You'll explore all the layers of a Xamarin app, from design to deployment.

The second edition of this textbook has been fully revised and adds material about loop optimisation, function call optimisation and dataflow analysis. It presents techniques for making realistic compilers for simple programming languages, using techniques that are close to those used in ""real"" compilers, albeit in places slightly simplified for presentation purposes. All phases required for translating a high-level language to symbolic machine language are covered, including lexing, parsing, type checking, intermediate-code generation, machine-code generation, register allocation and optimisation, interpretation is covered briefly. Aiming to be neutral with respect to implementation languages, algorithms are presented in pseudo-code rather than in any specific programming language, but suggestions are in many cases given for how these can be realised in different language flavours.Introduction to Compiler Design is intended for an introductory course in compiler design, suitable for both undergraduate and graduate courses depending on which chapters are used.

Modern compiler design,Dick Grune,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/1f/31/1e/1f311eec1b2027dba20c2eaf8240eb69.jpg,"
                    A compiler is one of the most vital parts of a computers system software, translating programs written in a high-level language into low-level commands that the machine can understand and execute. Most compiler design books focus only on techniques for imperative (or procedural) languages like C or Pascal, whereas Modern Compiler Design also covers compilation techniques for object-oriented, functional, logic and distributed languages. Features of the book include:A focus on essential traditional and advanced techniques common to all language paradigms, giving readers the skills required for modern compiler construction.Coverage of all the major programming language types - imperative, object-oriented, functional, logic and distributed languages.A practical emphasis on implementation and optimization techniques, including tools for automating compiler design.A strong intuitive style, illustrated by many practical examples.All the authors are experienced teachers and researchers in programming languages and their implementation and have acquired a wealth of experience in compiler construction for a variety of languages.

Compiler Design: Analysis and Transformation,Helmut Seidl,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/f3/10/ec/f310ec506c8e056e329fd58e114fbe17.jpg,"
While compilers for high-level programming languages are large complex software systems, they have particular characteristics that differentiate them from other software systems. Their functionality is almost completely well-defined - ideally there exist complete precise descriptions of the source and target languages. Additional descriptions of the interfaces to the operating system, programming system and programming environment, and to other compilers and libraries are often available. The book deals with the optimization phase of compilers. In this phase, programs are transformed in order to increase their efficiency. To preserve the semantics of the programs in these transformations, the compiler has to meet the associated applicability conditions. These are checked using static analysis of the programs. In this book the authors systematically describe the analysis and transformation of imperative and functional programs. In addition to a detailed description of important efficiency-improving transformations, the book offers a concise introduction to the necessary concepts and methods, namely to operational semantics, lattices, and fixed-point algorithms.This book is intended for students of computer science. The book is supported throughout with examples, exercises and program fragments. ",https://1lib.in/dl/2065903/476d31,177,Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg,2012,english,"PDF, 1.02 MB"

                    Implementing the automation of electric distribution networks, from simple remote control to the application of software-based decision tools, requires many considerations, such as assessing costs, selecting the control infrastructure type and automation level, deciding on the ambition level, and justifying the solution through a business case. Control and Automation of Electric Power Distribution Systems addresses all of these issues to aid you in resolving automation problems and improving the management of your distribution network.
Bringing together automation concepts as they apply to utility distribution systems, this volume presents the theoretical and practical details of a control and automation solution for the entire distribution system of substations and feeders. The fundamentals of this solution include depth of control, boundaries of control responsibility, stages of automation, automation intensity levels, and automated device preparedness. To meet specific performance goals, the authors discuss distribution planning, performance calculations, and protection to facilitate the selection of the primary device, associated secondary control, and fault indicators. The book also provides two case studies that illustrate the business case for distribution automation (DA) and methods for calculating benefits, including the assessment of crew time savings.
As utilities strive for better economies, DA, along with other tools described in this volume, help to achieve improved management of the distribution network. Using Control and Automation of Electric Power Distribution Systems, you can embark on the automation solution best suited for your needs.

This third edition of a classic textbook can be used to teach at the senior undergraduate and graduate levels. The material concentrates on fundamental theories as well as techniques and algorithms. The advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web, and, more recently, the emergence of cloud computing and streaming data applications, has forced a renewal of interest in distributed and parallel data management, while, at the same time, requiring a rethinking of some of the traditional techniques. This book covers the breadth and depth of this re-emerging field. The coverage consists of two parts. The first part discusses the fundamental principles of distributed data management and includes distribution design, data integration, distributed query processing and optimization, distributed transaction management, and replication. The second part focuses on more advanced topics and includes discussion of parallel database systems, distributed object management, peer-to-peer data management, web data management, data stream systems, and cloud computing. New in this Edition: • New chapters, covering database replication, database integration, multidatabase query processing, peer-to-peer data management, and web data management. • Coverage of emerging topics such as data streams and cloud computing • Extensive revisions and updates based on years of class testing and feedback Ancillary teaching materials are available.

Programming distributed computing systems: a foundational approach,Varela C.A.,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/ee/1d/22/ee1d222bab0953ae7d3b05a91d883d91.jpg,"
Starting from the premise that understanding the foundations of concurrent programming is key to developing distributed computing systems, this book first presents the fundamental theories of concurrent computing and then introduces the programming languages that help develop distributed computing systems at a high level of abstraction. The major theories of concurrent computation -- including the p-calculus, the actor model, the join calculus, and mobile ambients -- are explained with a focus on how they help design and reason about distributed and mobile computing systems. The book then presents programming languages that follow the theoretical models already described, including Pict, SALSA, and JoCaml. The parallel structure of the chapters in both part one (theory) and part two (practice) enable the reader not only to compare the different theories but also to see clearly how a programming language supports a theoretical model. The book is unique in bridging the gap between the theory and the practice of programming distributed computing systems. It can be used as a textbook for graduate and advanced undergraduate students in computer science or as a reference for researchers in the area of programming technology for distributed computing. By presenting theory first, the book allows readers to focus on the essential components of concurrency, distribution, and mobility without getting bogged down in syntactic details of specific programming languages. Once the theory is understood, the practical part of implementing a system in an actual programming language becomes much easier.

                    InTech, 2012. — 390 p.We live in an era of unimaginably rapidly advancing and amazing technologies that enable instantaneous flow of information – anytime, anywhere. The convergence of computers and networks has been the key force behind the development of these awesome technologies. Increasing use of systems which are built using advanced information technologies is having a profound impact on our everyday lives. These technologies are becoming all pervasive and ubiquitous.With the exponential growth of wireless telecommunication and information technologies and the increasingly dominant roles played by electronic commerce in every major industry, safeguarding of information travelling over the communication networks is increasingly becoming one of the most important and contentious challenges for the technology innovators. The key prerequisite for the continued development and successful exploitation of information technology and other related industries is the notion of information assurance that includes operations for protecting and defending information and information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and information confidentiality and privacy.In this age of electronic connectivity, of viruses and hackers, of electronic eavesdropping and electronic fraud, network security has assumed increasing importance. Two trends are emerging very clearly in this regard. First, the explosive growth in computer systems and their interconnections via networks has increased the dependence of both organizations and individuals on the information stored and communicated using these systems. This, in turn, has led to a heightened awareness of the need to protect data and resources from disclosure, to guarantee the authenticity of data and messages, and to protect systems from network-based attacks. Second, the disciplines of cryptography and network security have matured, leading to the development of practical, readily available applications to enforce network security. Cryptography will continue to play lead roles in developing new security solutions which will be in great demand with the advent of high-speed next-generation communication systems and networks. New cryptographic algorithms, protocols and tools must follow up in order to adapt to the new communication and computing technologies. Computing systems and communication protocols like IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15 are increasingly becoming targets of attacks since the underlying radio communication medium for wireless networks provides serious security loopholes. New security mechanisms should be designed to defend against the increasingly complex and sophisticated attacks launched on networks and web-based applications. In addition to classical cryptographic algorithms, new approaches like chaos-based cryptography, DNA-based cryptography and quantum cryptography will be play important roles.The purpose of this book is to present some of the critical security challenges in today’s communication networks and computing and to provide insights to possible mechanisms to defend against attacks. With this objective, the book provides a collection of research work in the field of cryptography and network security by some experts in these areas. The book contains 16 chapters which are divided into three parts. The chapters in Part 1 of the book largely deal with security and privacy issues in computing and communication networks.

                    About this book

Take your distributed applications to the next level and see what the reference architectures associated with microservices can do for you. This book begins by showing you the distributed computing architecture landscape and provides an in-depth view of microservices architecture. Following this, you will work with CQRS, an essential pattern for microservices, and get a view of how distributed messaging works. Moving on, you will take a deep dive into Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. 
Coming back to CQRS, you will learn how event-driven microservices work with this pattern, using the Axon 2 framework. This takes you on to how transactions work with microservices followed by advanced architectures to address non-functional aspects such as high availability and scalability. In the concluding part of the book you develop your own enterprise-grade microservices application using the Axon framework and true BASE transactions, while making it as secure as possible.

                    There is no field of enterprise today more dynamic or more challenging than Digital Integrated Circuits. But because of its rapid development, the field has quickly outgrown most of the standard textbooks. The field is also decidedly interdisciplinary. Engineers now must understand materials, physics, devices, processing electromagnetics, computer tools, and economics along with circuits and design rules, but few if any texts take the interdisciplinary approach that best prepares students for their future studies and practice.Author John Ayers designed Digital Integrated Circuits: Analysis and Design to meet three primary objectives:·Take an interdisciplinary approach that will stay relevant for years to come·Provide broad coverage of the field relevant to students interested in designing integrated circuits and to those aiming towards designing with integrated circuits·Focus on the underlying principles rather than the details of current technologies that will soon be obsoleteRich with pedagogical features and supplementary materials, this book appears destined to set a new standard for digital integrated circuits texts.

This book, Electronic Devices and Circuit Application, is the first of four books of a larger work, Fundamentals of Electronics. It is comprised of four chapters describing the basic operation of each of the four fundamental building blocks of modern electronics: operational amplifiers, semiconductor diodes, bipolar junction transistors, and field effect transistors. Attention is focused on the reader obtaining a clear understanding of each of the devices when it is operated in equilibrium. Ideas fundamental to the study of electronic circuits are also developed in the book at a basic level to lessen the possibility of misunderstandings at a higher level. The difference between linear and non-linear operation is explored through the use of a variety of circuit examples including amplifiers constructed with operational amplifiers as the fundamental component and elementary digital logic gates constructed with various transistor types. Fundamentals of Electronics has been designed primarily for use in an upper division course in electronics for electrical engineering students. Typically such a course spans a full academic years consisting of two semesters or three quarters. As such, Electronic Devices and Circuit Applications, and the following two books, Amplifiers: Analysis and Design and Active Filters and Amplifier Frequency Response, form an appropriate body of material for such a course. Secondary applications include the use in a one-semester electronics course for engineers or as a reference for practicing engineers.

This book, Electronic Devices and Circuit Application, is the first of four books of a larger work, Fundamentals of Electronics. It is comprised of four chapters describing the basic operation of each of the four fundamental building blocks of modern electronics: operational amplifiers, semiconductor diodes, bipolar junction transistors, and field effect transistors. Attention is focused on the reader obtaining a clear understanding of each of the devices when it is operated in equilibrium. Ideas fundamental to the study of electronic circuits are also developed in the book at a basic level to lessen the possibility of misunderstandings at a higher level. The difference between linear and non-linear operation is explored through the use of a variety of circuit examples including amplifiers constructed with operational amplifiers as the fundamental component and elementary digital logic gates constructed with various transistor types. Fundamentals of Electronics has been designed primarily for use in an upper division course in electronics for electrical engineering students. Typically such a course spans a full academic years consisting of two semesters or three quarters. As such, Electronic Devices and Circuit Applications, and the following two books, Amplifiers: Analysis and Design and Active Filters and Amplifier Frequency Response, form an appropriate body of material for such a course. Secondary applications include the use in a one-semester electronics course for engineers or as a reference for practicing engineers.

Using the concept of ""abstraction,"" the book attempts to form a bridge between the world of physics and the world of large computer systems. In particular, it attempts to unify electrical engineering and computer science as the art of creating and exploiting successive abstractions to manage the complexity of building useful electrical systems. Computer systems are simply one type of electrical systems.

FPGA-based Implementation of Signal Processing Systems,Roger Woods,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/f0/d4/73/f0d473cab24cc87c18beb9dbf30ca805.jpg,"
                    Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an increasingly popular technology for implementing digital signal processing (DSP) systems. By allowing designers to create circuit architectures developed for the specific applications, high levels of performance can be achieved for many DSP applications providing considerable improvements over conventional microprocessor and dedicated DSP processor solutions. The book addresses the key issue in this process specifically, the methods and tools needed for the design, optimization and implementation of DSP systems in programmable FPGA hardware. It presents a review of the leading-edge techniques in this field, analyzing advanced DSP-based design flows for both signal flow graph- (SFG-) based and dataflow-based implementation, system on chip (SoC) aspects, and future trends and challenges for FPGAs. The automation of the techniques for component architectural synthesis, computational models, and the reduction of energy consumption to help improve FPGA performance, are given in detail.        Written from a system level design perspective and with a DSP focus, the authors present many practical application examples of complex DSP implementation, involving:       high-performance computing e.g. matrix operations such as matrix multiplication;      high-speed filtering including finite impulse response (FIR) filters and wave digital filters (WDFs);      adaptive filtering e.g. recursive least squares (RLS) filtering;      transforms such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT).            FPGA-based Implementation of Signal Processing Systems  is an important reference for practising engineers and researchers working on the design and development of DSP systems for radio, telecommunication, information, audio-visual and security applications.

                    This book explores the implementation of MATLAB(R) and Simulink(R) in the development of embedded robust control systems. Robust control theory allows for changes in a system whilst maintaining stability and performance. Applications of this technique are very important for dependable embedded systems, making technologies such as drones and other autonomous systems with sophisticated embedded controllers and systems relatively common-place.Three extended case studies are developed in depth: embedded control of a tank physical model; robust control of a miniature helicopter; and robust control of two-wheeled robots. These are taken from the area of motion control but the book may be also used by designers in other areas.Some knowledge of linear control theory is assumed and experience of C programming is desirable but to make the book accessible to engineers new to the field and to students, the authors avoid complicated mathematical proofs and overwhelming computer architecture technical details.

This book contains more than 1000 exercises in probability and random processes, together with their solutions. Apart from being a volume of worked exercises in its own right, it is also a solutions manual for exercises and problems appearing in our textbook Probability and Random Processes (3rd edn), Oxford University Press, 2001, henceforth referred to as PRP. These exercises are not merely for drill, but complement and illustrate the text of PRP, or are entertaining, or both. The current volume extends our earlier book Probability and Random Processes: Problems and Solutions, and includes in addition around 400 new problems. Since many exercises have multiple parts, the total number of interrogatives exceeds 3000.Despite being intended in part as a companion to PRP, the present volume is as self-contained as reasonably possible. Where knowledge of a substantial chunk of bookwork is unavoidable, the reader is provided with a reference to the relevant passage in PRP. Expressions such as `clearly' appear frequently in the solutions. Although we do not use such terms in their Laplacian sense to mean `with difficulty', to call something `clear' is not to imply that explicit verification is necessarily free of tedium.The table of contents reproduces that of PRP; the section numbers for the exercises correspond to those of PRP, and all questions are numbered as they appear in the third edition of PRP. The covered range of topics is broad, beginning with the elementary theory of probability and random variables, and continuing, via chapters on Markov chains and convergence, to extensive sections devoted to stationarity and ergodic theory, renewals, queues, martingales, and diffusions, including an introduction to the pricing of options. Generally speaking, exercises are questions which test knowledge of particular pieces of theory, while problems are less specific in their requirements. There are questions of all standards, the great majority being elementary or of intermediate difficulty. We ourselves have found some of the later ones to be rather tricky, but have refrained from magnifying any difficulty by adding asterisks or equivalent devices. If you are using this book for self-study, our advice would be not to attempt more than a respectable fraction of these at a first read.

                    The third edition of this text gives a rigorous introduction to probability theory and the discussion of the most important random processes in some depth. It includes various topics which are suitable for undergraduate courses, but are not routinely taught. It is suitable to the beginner, and should provide a taste and encouragement for more advanced work.There are four main aims: 1) to provide a thorough but straightforward account of basic probability, giving the reader a natural feel for the subject unburdened by oppressive technicalities, 2) to discuss important random processes in depth with many examples. 3) to cover a range of important but less routine topics, 4) to impart to the beginner the flavour of more advanced work. The books begins with basic ideas common to many undergraduate courses in mathematics, statistics and the sciences; in concludes with topics usually found at graduate level.

                    Probability and Statistics are as much about intuition and problem solving as they are about theorem proving. Because of this, students can find it very difficult to make a successful transition from lectures to examinations to practice, since the problems involved can vary so much in nature. Since the subject is critical in many modern applications such as mathematical finance, quantitative management, telecommunications, signal processing, bioinformatics, as well as traditional ones such as insurance, social science and engineering, the authors have rectified deficiencies in traditional lecture-based methods by collecting together a wealth of exercises with complete solutions, adapted to needs and skills of students. Following on from the success of Probability and Statistics by Example: Basic Probability and Statistics, the authors here concentrate on random processes, particularly Markov processes, emphasizing models rather than general constructions. Basic mathematical facts are supplied as and when they are needed and historical information is sprinkled throughout.

Probability, Random Variables, and Random Processes is a comprehensive textbook on probability theory for engineers that provides a more rigorous mathematical framework than is usually encountered in undergraduate courses. It is intended for first-year graduate students who have some familiarity with probability and random variables, though not necessarily of random processes and systems that operate on random signals. It is also appropriate for advanced undergraduate students who have a strong mathematical background.The book has the following features:Several appendices include related material on integration, important inequalities and identities, frequency-domain transforms, and linear algebra. These topics have been included so that the book is relatively self-contained. One appendix contains an extensive summary of 33 random variables and their properties such as moments, characteristic functions, and entropy.Unlike most books on probability, numerous figures have been included to clarify and expand upon important points. Over 600 illustrations and MATLAB plots have been designed to reinforce the material and illustrate the various characterizations and properties of random quantities.Sufficient statistics are covered in detail, as is their connection to parameter estimation techniques. These include classical Bayesian estimation and several optimality criteria: mean-square error, mean-absolute error, maximum likelihood, method of moments, and least squares.The last four chapters provide an introduction to several topics usually studied in subsequent engineering courses: communication systems and information theory; optimal filtering (Wiener and Kalman); adaptive filtering (FIR and IIR); and antenna beamforming, channel equalization, and direction finding. This material is available electronically at the companion website.Probability, Random Variables, and Random Processes is the only textbook on probability for engineers that includes relevant background material, provides extensive summaries of key results, and extends various statistical techniques to a range of applications in signal processing.

                    This book shows how to model selected communication scenarios using game theory. The book helps researchers specifically dealing with scenarios motivated by the increasing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G Communications by using game theory to approach the study of such challenging scenarios. The author explains how game theory acts as a mathematical tool that models decision making in terms of strategies and mechanisms that can result in optimal payoffs for a number of interacting entities, offering often antagonistic behaviors. The book explores new technologies in terms of design, development and management from a theoretical perspective, using game theory to analyze strategic situations and demonstrate profitable behaviors of the cooperative entities. The book identifies and explores several significant applications/uses/situations that arise from the vast deployment of the IoT. The presentation of the technological scenarios is followed in each of the first four chapters by a step-by-step theoretical model often followed by equilibrium proof, and numerical simulation results, that are explained in a tutorial-like manner. The four chapters tackle challenging IoT and 5G related issues, including: new security threats that IoT brings, e.g. botnets, ad hoc vehicular networks and the need for trust in vehicular communications, content repetition by offloading traffic onto mobile users, as well as issues due to new wearable devices that enable data collection to become more intrusive.

                    The subject of adaptive filters constitutes an important part of statistical signal processing. Whenever there is a requirement to process signals that result from operation in an
environment of unknown statistics or one that is inherently nonstationary, the use of
an adaptive filter offers a highly attractive solution to the problem as it provides a significant improvement in performance over the use of a fixed filter designed by conventional methods. Furthermore, the use of adaptive filters provides new signal-processing
capabilities that would not be possible otherwise. We thus find that adaptive filters have
been successfully applied in such diverse fields as communications, control, radar, sonar,

The story of two brilliant nineteenth-century scientists who discovered the electromagnetic field, laying the groundwork for the amazing technological and theoretical breakthroughs of the twentieth centuryTwo of the boldest and most creative scientists of all time were Michael Faraday (1791-1867) and James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879). This is the story of how these two men - separated in age by forty years - discovered the existence of the electromagnetic field and devised a radically new theory which overturned the strictly mechanical view of the world that had prevailed since Newton's time.The authors, veteran science writers with special expertise in physics and engineering, have created a lively narrative that interweaves rich biographical detail from each man's life with clear explanations of their scientific accomplishments. Faraday was an autodidact, who overcame class prejudice and a lack of mathematical training to become renowned for his acute powers of experimental observation, technological skills, and prodigious scientific imagination. James Clerk Maxwell was highly regarded as one of the most brilliant mathematical physicists of the age. He made an enormous number of advances in his own right. But when he translated Faraday's ideas into mathematical language, thus creating field theory, this unified framework of electricity, magnetism and light became the basis for much of later, 20th-century physics.Faraday's and Maxwell's collaborative efforts gave rise to many of the technological innovations we take for granted today - from electric power generation to television, and much more. Told with panache, warmth, and clarity, this captivating story of their greatest work - in which each played an equal part - and their inspiring lives will bring new appreciation to these giants of science.

                    The evaluation of electromagnetic field coupling to transmission lines is animportant problem in electromagnetic compatibility. The use of the transmission line (TL) approximation theory has permitted the solution of a large range of problems (e. g. lightning and EMP interaction with power lines). However, the continual increase in operating frequency of products and higher-frequency sources of disturbances (such as UWB systems) makes TL basic assumptions no longer acceptable for a certain number of applications. In the last decade or so, the generalization of classical TL theory to take into account high frequency effects has emerged as an important topic of study in electromagnetic compatibility. This effort resulted in the elaboration ofthe so-called ""generalized"" or ""full-wave"" TL theory, which incorporates high frequency radiation effects, while keeping the relative simplicity of TL equations.This book is organized in two main parts. Part I presents consolidatedknowledge of classical transmission line theory and differentfield-to-transmission line coupling models. Part II presents differentapproaches developed to generalize TL Theory.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/1227911/4e9c89,280,WIT Press / Computational Mechanics,2008,english,"PDF, 3.96 MB"

                    How does Instagram shape how we relate to each other online? Are users concerned about privacy when documenting their lives in fine detail? How does Instagram work as a marketing machine? Drawing on three years' research with Instagram users, Elisa Serafinelli explores how Instagram is changing people's visual experiences.

Instagram is now by far the most popular online photo sharing platform, fuelled by the growth of smart mobile devices, and the management of an online persona is now part of millions of people's everyday reality. This has not gone unnoticed among commercial actors, with the savviest of these exploiting the social dynamics of sharing that underlie the very logic of Instagram.

This book addresses the issue of how mobile media and visual communication permeate people's daily routines, how marketing influences practice, whether privacy and surveillance concerns are a reality, and how the platform shapes social relationships and identity formation. In its conclusion, the book advances the innovative concept of new mobile visualities to describe the social communication of photography and its huge expansion.

Recognizing that developments in technology, business, and culture require a fresh approach, Janis T. Page and Lawrence Parnell have written a practical introductory text that aligns these shifts with the body of knowledge from which the discipline of public relations was built. Because the practice of public relations is rooted in credibility, the authors believe that you must become ethical and socially responsible communicators more concerned with building trust and respect with diverse communities than with creating throwaway content. The authors balance this approach with a focus on communication theory, history, process, and practice and on understanding how these apply to strategic public relations planning, as well as on learning how to create a believable and persuasive message.Key FeaturesChapter-opening Scenarioscapture your attention by discussing current PR challenges--such as the Wells Fargo cross-selling, VW emissions cover-up, and P&G's ""Like a Girl"" campaign--and thus frame the chapter content and encourage active reading. At the end of the chapter, you explore various aspects of socially responsible communication to ""solve"" the PR challenge.Socially Responsible Case Studiesin each chapter illustrate the key responsibilities of a modern public relations professional such as media relations, crisis communications, employee communications, applied communications research, and corporate and government-specific communications. Each case featuresproblem-solving questionsto encourage critical thinking.Social Responsibility in Actionboxes feature short, specific social responsibility cases--such as Universals' #NoFoodWasted, Nespresso in South Sudan, and Merck's collaboration with AIDS activists--to highlight best practices and effective tactics, showing the link between sound public relations strategy and meaningful social responsibility programs.Insightboxes spark classroom discussion on particularly important or unique topics in each chapter.Personality Profileboxes will inspire you with stories from PR veterans and rising stars such as the U.S. CEO of Burson-Marstellor, the Chief Communication Officer of the United Nations Foundation, and the Executive VP at HavasPR.

Discrete-time Signal Processing: An Algebraic Approach,Darrell Williamson PhD (auth.),https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/38/75/b8/3875b8e873c774b79018213c7cafc153.jpg,"
The topics of control engineering and signal processing continue to flourish and develop. In common with general scientific investigation, new ideas, concepts and interpretations emerge quite spontaneously and these are then discussed, used, discarded or subsumed into the prevailing subject paradigm. Sometimes these innovative concepts coalesce into a new sub-discipline within the broad subject tapestry ofcontrol and signal processing. This preliminary battle between old and new usually takes place at conferences, through the internet and in the journals of the discipline. After a little more maturity has been acquired by the new concepts then archival publication as a scientific or engineering monograph may occur. The applications ofsignal processing techniques have grown and grown. They now cover the wide range from the statistical properties of signals and data through to the hardware problems of communications in all its diverse aspects. Supporting this range ofapplications is a body of theory, analysis and techniques which is equally broad. Darrell Williamson has faced the difficult task of organising this material by adopting an algebraic approach. This uses general mathematical and systems ideas and results to form a firm foundation for the discrete signal processing paradigm. Although this may require some extra concentration and involvement by the student or researcher, the rewards are a clarity of presentation and deeper insight into the power of individual results. An additional benefit is that the algebraic language used is the natural language of computing tools like MATLAB and its simulation facility, SIMULINK.

Joint Source-Channel Coding of Discrete-Time Signals with Continuous Amplitudes (Communications and Signal Processing),Norbert Goertz,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/11/17/b6/1117b6c8cffb70ad212a0d16df75d2c0.jpg,"
                    This book provides the first comprehensive and easy-to-read discussion of joint source-channel encoding and decoding for source signals with continuous amplitudes. It is a state-of-the-art presentation of this exciting, thriving field of research, making pioneering contributions to the new concept of source-adaptive modulation. The book starts with the basic theory and the motivation for a joint realization of source and channel coding. Specialized chapters deal with practically relevant scenarios such as iterative source-channel decoding and its optimization for a given encoder, and also improved encoder designs by channel-adaptive quantization or source-adaptive modulation.Although Information Theory is not the main topic of the book - in fact, the concept of joint source-channel coding is contradictory to the classical system design motivated by a questionable practical interpretation of the separation theorem - this theory still provides the ultimate performance limits for any practical system, whether it uses joint source-channel coding or not.  Therefore, the theoretical limits are presented in a self-contained appendix, which is a useful reference also for those not directly interested in the main topic of this book.

                    This book shows how to model selected communication scenarios using game theory. The book helps researchers specifically dealing with scenarios motivated by the increasing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G Communications by using game theory to approach the study of such challenging scenarios. The author explains how game theory acts as a mathematical tool that models decision making in terms of strategies and mechanisms that can result in optimal payoffs for a number of interacting entities, offering often antagonistic behaviors. The book explores new technologies in terms of design, development and management from a theoretical perspective, using game theory to analyze strategic situations and demonstrate profitable behaviors of the cooperative entities. The book identifies and explores several significant applications/uses/situations that arise from the vast deployment of the IoT. The presentation of the technological scenarios is followed in each of the first four chapters by a step-by-step theoretical model often followed by equilibrium proof, and numerical simulation results, that are explained in a tutorial-like manner. The four chapters tackle challenging IoT and 5G related issues, including: new security threats that IoT brings, e.g. botnets, ad hoc vehicular networks and the need for trust in vehicular communications, content repetition by offloading traffic onto mobile users, as well as issues due to new wearable devices that enable data collection to become more intrusive.

 The Accessible Guide to Modern Wireless Communication for Undergraduates, Graduates, and Practicing Electrical Engineers    Wireless communication is a critical discipline of electrical engineering and computer science, yet the concepts have remained elusive for students who are not specialists in the area. This text makes digital communication and receiver algorithms for wireless communication broadly accessible to undergraduates, graduates, and practicing electrical engineers. Notably, the book builds on a signal processing foundation and does not require prior courses on analog or digital communication.     Introduction to Wireless Digital Communication  establishes the principles of communication, from a digital signal processing perspective, including key mathematical background, transmitter and receiver signal processing algorithms, channel models, and generalizations to multiple antennas. Robert Heath’s “less is more” approach focuses on typical solutions to common problems in wireless engineering.   Heath presents digital communication fundamentals from a signal processing perspective, focusing on the complex pulse amplitude modulation approach used in most commercial wireless systems. He describes specific receiver algorithms for implementing wireless communication links, including synchronization, carrier frequency offset estimation, channel estimation, and equalization. While most concepts are presented for systems with single transmit and receive antennas, Heath concludes by extending those concepts to contemporary MIMO systems.   To promote learning, each chapter includes previews, bullet-point summaries, examples, and numerous homework problems to help readers test their knowledge.    Basics of wireless communication: applications, history, and the central role of signal processing Digital communication essentials: components, channels, distortion, coding/decoding, encryption, and modulation/demodulation Signal processing: linear time invariant systems, probability/random processes, Fourier transforms, derivation of complex baseband signal representation and equivalent channels, and multi-rate signal processing Least-squared estimation techniques that build on the linear algebra typically taught to electrical engineering undergraduates Complex pulse amplitude modulation: symbol mapping, constellations, signal bandwidth, and noise Synchronization, including symbol, frame, and carrier frequency offset Frequency selective channel estimation and equalization MIMO techniques using multiple transmit and/or receive antennas, including SIMO, MISO, and MIMO-OFDM     Register your product at informit.com/register for convenient access to downloads, updates, and corrections as they become available.

                    Chöying Tobden Dorje's magnum opus presented in English for the first time, in an authoritative translation prepared under the auspices of well-known and highly respected Tibetan teachers and translators.


In 1838, Choying Tobden Dorje, a yogin and scholar of northeastern Tibet, completed a multivolume masterwork that traces the entire path of the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism from beginning to end. Written by a mantra practitioner for the benefit of mantra practitioners living among the lay community, it was intended to be informative, inspirational, and above all, practical. Its twenty-five books, or topical divisions, offer a comprehensive and detailed view of the Buddhist path according to the early translation school of Tibetan Buddhism, spanning the vast range of Buddhist teachings from the initial steps to the highest esoteric teachings of great perfection. Choying Tobden Dorje’s magnum opus appears in English here for the first time.

Book 13 presents the philosophical systems of India and Tibet, according to the writings of Longchen Rabjam and the revelations of Orgyan Lingpa. First, it discusses the views attributed to classical Hinduism, Jainism, materialism, and nihilism. Second, it describes the standpoints of the Vaibhashika and Sautrantika exponents of the lesser vehicle, exemplified by pious attendants and hermit buddhas, and the Cittamatra (“mind only”) and Madhyamaka (“middle way”) commentators of the great vehicle, exemplified by great bodhisattva beings. Third, it analyzes the inner and outer vehicles of the Buddhist tantras, with an emphasis on the three classes of the great perfection. Fourth, it documents the lines of philosophical transmission within Tibet, including Bon, Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya, Kadampa, and Geluk. It concludes with an extract from a well-known treatise of the Fifth Dalai Lama, applying the techniques of consequential reasoning to the first chapter of Vasubandhu’s Treasury of Phenomenology.

                    The evaluation of electromagnetic field coupling to transmission lines is animportant problem in electromagnetic compatibility. The use of the transmission line (TL) approximation theory has permitted the solution of a large range of problems (e. g. lightning and EMP interaction with power lines). However, the continual increase in operating frequency of products and higher-frequency sources of disturbances (such as UWB systems) makes TL basic assumptions no longer acceptable for a certain number of applications. In the last decade or so, the generalization of classical TL theory to take into account high frequency effects has emerged as an important topic of study in electromagnetic compatibility. This effort resulted in the elaboration ofthe so-called ""generalized"" or ""full-wave"" TL theory, which incorporates high frequency radiation effects, while keeping the relative simplicity of TL equations.This book is organized in two main parts. Part I presents consolidatedknowledge of classical transmission line theory and differentfield-to-transmission line coupling models. Part II presents differentapproaches developed to generalize TL Theory.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/1227911/4e9c89,280,WIT Press / Computational Mechanics,2008,english,"PDF, 3.96 MB"

                    In the last 30 years there have been dramatic changes in electrical technology--yet the length of the undergraduate curriculum has remained four years.  Until some ten years ago, the analysis of transmission lines was a standard topic in the EE and CpE undergraduate curricula.  Today most of the undergraduate curricula contain a rather brief study of the analysis of transmission lines in a one-semester junior-level course on electromagnetics. In some schools, this study of transmission lines is relegated to a senior technical elective or has disappeared from the curriculum altogether.  This raises a serious problem in the preparation of EE and CpE undergraduates to be competent in the modern industrial world.  For the reasons mentioned above, today's undergraduates lack the basic skills to design high-speed digital and high-frequency analog systems.  It does little good to write sophisticated software if the hardware is unable to process the instructions.  This problem will increase as the speeds and frequencies of these systems continue to increase seemingly without bound.  This book is meant to repair that basic deficiency.Content: Chapter 1 Basic Skills and Concepts Having Application to Transmission Lines (pages 1–48): Chapter 2 Time?Domain Analysis of Two?Conductor Lines (pages 49–120): Chapter 3 Frequency?Domain Analysis of Two?Conductor Lines (pages 121–174): Chapter 4 The Transmission?Line Equations for Three?Conductor Lines (pages 175–206): Chapter 5 Solution of the Transmission?Line Equations for Three?Conductor Lossless Lines (pages 207–238): Chapter 6 Solution of the Transmission?Line Equations for Three?Conductor Lossy Lines (pages 239–271):                ",https://1lib.in/dl/2156728/84185f,306,,2010,english,"PDF, 12.48 MB"

One of us (FAB) published a book Problems in Electronics with Solutions in 1957 which became well established and ran to five editions, the last revised and enlarged edition appearing in 1976. When the first edition was written it covered almost the complete undergraduate electronics courses in engin­ eering at universities. One book, at a price students can afford, can no longer cover an undergraduate course in electronics. It has therefore been decided to produce a book covering one important section of such a course using the experience gained and a few problems from previous editions of Problems in Electronics with Solutions. The book is based largely on problems collected by us over many years and given to undergraduate electronic and electrical engineers. Its purpose is to present the problems, together with a large number of their solutions, in the hope that it will prove valuable to undergraduates and other teachers. It should also be useful for Master's degree students in electronic and electrical engineering and physics, research workers, engineers and scientists in industry and as a reference source.

Transmission Lines in Digital Systems for EMC Practitioners,Clayton R. Paul(auth.),https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/57/b8/1c/57b81c8d1b3805bbb07529efae4cd1a7.jpg,"
                    This is a brief but comprehensive book covering the set of EMC skills that EMC practitioners today require in order to be successful in high-speed, digital electronics.  The basic skills in the book are new and weren’t studied in most curricula some ten years ago.  The rapidly changing digital technology has created this demand for a discussion of new analysis skills particularly for the analysis of transmission lines where the conductors that interconnect the electronic modules have become “electrically large,” longer than a tenth of a wavelength, which are increasingly becoming important.  Crosstalk between the lines is also rapidly becoming a significant problem in getting modern electronic systems to work satisfactorily.  Hence this text concentrates on the modeling of “electrically large” connection conductors where previously-used Kirchhoff’s voltage and current laws and lumped-circuit modeling have become obsolete because of the increasing speeds of modern digital systems.  This has caused an increased emphasis on Signal Integrity. Until as recently as some ten years ago, digital system clock speeds and data rates were in the hundreds of megahertz (MHz) range.  Prior to that time, the “lands” on printed circuit boards (PCBs) that interconnect the electronic modules had little or no impact on the proper functioning of those electronic circuits.  Today, the clock and data speeds have moved into the low gigahertz (GHz) range.Content: Chapter 1 Transmission Lines: Physical Dimensions vs. Electric Dimensions (pages 1–29): Chapter 2 Time?Domain Analysis of Two?Conductor Lines (pages 31–101): Chapter 3 Frequency?Domain Analysis of Two?Conductor Lines (pages 103–123): Chapter 4 Crosstalk in Three?Conductor Lines (pages 125–154): Chapter 5 The Approximate Inductive–Capacitive Crosstalk Model (pages 155–209): Chapter 6 The Exact Crosstalk Prediction Model (pages 211–244):                ",https://1lib.in/dl/2156729/378c2c,275,,2011,english,"PDF, 13.69 MB"

The book deals with theoretical and experimental research of antennas. The presentation is based on the electromagnetic theory. It begins with the theory of thin antennas. Thin antennas represent one of the main types of radiators, thus the theory of thin antennas is the basis of the antennas analysis.  Special attention is paid to the integral equation of Leontovich-Levin for a current along a straight thin-walled metal cylinder, which is equivalent to the equation of Hallen with a precise kernel. Together with the analysis of various types of antennas, the book deals with the problems of synthesis including the creation a wide-band radiator by means of determining of the types and the magnitudes of concentrated loads, which are connected along a linear radiator and create in a given frequency band high electrical performance.  Problems of antenna engineering are discussed in the second half of the book, including the results of application of a compensation method for the protection of humans against irradiation and structural features of ship antennas.

                    This book describes a new concept for analyzing RF/microwave circuits, which includes RF/microwave antennas. The book is unique in its emphasis on practical and innovative microwave RF engineering applications. The analysis is based on nonlinear dynamics and chaos models and shows comprehensive benefits and results. All conceptual RF microwave circuits and antennas are innovative and can be broadly implemented in engineering applications.Given the dynamics of RF microwave circuits and antennas, they are suitable for use in a broad range of applications. The book presents analytical methods for microwave RF antennas and circuit analysis, concrete examples, and geometric examples. The analysis is developed systematically, starting with basic differential equations and their bifurcations, and subsequently moving on to fixed point analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations.Engineering applications include microwave RF circuits and antennas in a variety of topological structures, RFID ICs and antennas, microstrips, circulators, cylindrical RF network antennas, Tunnel Diodes (TDs), bipolar transistors, field effect transistors (FETs), IMPATT amplifiers, Small Signal (SS) amplifiers, Bias-T circuits, PIN diode circuits, power amplifiers, oscillators, resonators, filters, N-turn antennas, dual spiral coil antennas, helix antennas, linear dipole and slot arrays, and hybrid translinear circuits. In each chapter, the concept is developed from the basic assumptions up to the final engineering outcomes. The scientific background is explained at basic and advanced levels and closely integrated with mathematical theory.The book also includes a wealth of examples, making it ideal for intermediate graduate level studies. It is aimed at electrical and electronic engineers, RF and microwave engineers, students and researchers in physics, and will also greatly benefit all engineers who have had no formal instruction in nonlinear dynamics, but who now desire to bridge the gap between innovative microwave RF circuits and antennas and advanced mathematical analysis methods.

                    Forthcoming wireless multi-hop networks such as ad hoc and sensor networks will allow network nodes to control the communication topology by choosing their transmitting ranges. Briefly, topology control (TC) is the art of co-ordinating nodes' decisions regarding their transmitting ranges, to generate a network with the desired features.  Building an optimized network topology helps surpass the prevalent scalability and capacity problems. Topology Control in Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks makes the case for topology control and provides an exhaustive coverage of TC techniques in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, considering both stationary networks, to which most of the existing solutions are tailored, and mobile networks. The author introduces a new taxonomy of topology control and gives a full explication of the applications and challenges of this important topic. Topology Control in Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks: * Defines topology control and explains its necessity, considering both stationary and mobile networks. * Describes the most representative TC protocols and their performance. * Covers the critical transmitting range for stationary and mobile networks, topology optimization problems such as energy efficiency, and distributed topology control. * Discusses implementation and 'open issues', including realistic models and the effect of multi-hop data traffic. * Presents a case study on routing protocol design, to demonstrate how TCcan ease the design of cooperative routing protocols. This invaluable text will provide graduate students in Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Applied Mathematics and Physics, researchers in the field of ad hoc networking, and professionals in wireless telecoms as well as networking system developers with a single reference resource on topology control.

                    Two new fields have recently appeared: mobile ad hoc networks and sensor networks. The emergence of these very promising systems is mainly due to great technological progress in the field of wireless communication protocols; these will make it possible to offer a broad range of new applications in both civilian and militarian domains. The inherent characteristics of these systems imply new challenges. This book deals with several relevant fields related to the evolution of these spontaneous and self-organized networks. The authors tackle critical problems such as the design of unicast/multicast routing protocols, the support of the quality of service, the security mechanisms for routing and data transmission, the service discovery, the techniques of clustering/self-organization, the mobility of code and the fault-tolerance techniques. The discussion adopts an analysis-oriented approach which aims to cover the current cutting-edge aspects of these fields and to highlight some potential future development, making it essential reading for anyone wishing to gain a better understanding of these exciting new areas.

                    The availability of cheaper, faster, and more reliable electronic components has stimulated important advances in computing and communication technologies. Theoretical and algorithmic approaches that address key issues in sensor networks, ad hoc wireless networks, and peer-to-peer networks play a central role in the development of emerging network paradigms. Filling the need for a comprehensive reference on recent developments, Handbook on Theoretical and Algorithmic Aspects of Sensor, Ad Hoc Wireless, and Peer-to-Peer Networks explores two questions: What are the central technical issues in these SAP networks? What are the possible solutions/tools available to address these issues? 
The editor brings together information from different research disciplines to initiate a comprehensive technical discussion on theoretical and algorithmic approaches to three related fields: sensor networks, ad hoc wireless networks, and peer-to-peer networks. With chapters written by authorities from Motorola, Bell Lab, and Honeywell, the book examines the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of recent developments and highlights future research challenges. The book's coverage includes theoretical and algorithmic methods and tools such as optimization, computational geometry, graph theory, and combinatorics. Although many books have emerged recently in this area, none of them address all three fields in terms of common issues.

Topology control is fundamental to solving  scalability and capacity problems in large-scale wireless ad hoc and sensor networks.          Forthcoming wireless multi-hop networks such as ad hoc and sensor networks will allow network nodes to control the communication topology by choosing their transmitting ranges. Briefly,  topology control  (TC) is the art of co-ordinating nodes’ decisions regarding their transmitting ranges, to generate a network with the desired features.  Building an optimized network topology helps surpass the prevalent scalability and capacity problems.         Topology Control in Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks  makes the case for topology control and provides an exhaustive coverage of TC techniques in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, considering both stationary networks, to which most of the existing solutions are tailored, and mobile networks. The author introduces a new taxonomy of topology control and gives a full explication of the applications and challenges of this important topic.         Topology Control in Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks:        Defines topology control and explains its necessity, considering both stationary and mobile networks.      Describes the most representative TC protocols and their performance.      Covers the critical transmitting range for stationary and mobile networks, topology optimization problems such as energy efficiency, and distributed topology control.      Discusses implementation and ‘open issues’, including realistic models and the effect of multi-hop data traffic.      Presents a case study on routing protocol design, to demonstrate how TC can ease the design of cooperative routing protocols.           This invaluable text will provide graduate students in Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Applied Mathematics and Physics, researchers in the field of ad hoc networking, and professionals in wireless telecoms as well as networking system developers with a single reference resource on topology control.

This textbook is designed for graduate-level courses, and for self-study, in analog and sampled-data, including switched-capacitor, circuit theory and design for ongoing, or active electrical engineers, needing to become proficient in analog circuit design on a system, rather than on a device, level. After decades of experience in industry and teaching this material in academic settings, the author has extracted many of the most important and useful features of analog circuit theory and design and presented them in a manner that is easy to digest and utilize. The methodology and analysis techniques presented can be applied to areas well beyond those specifically addressed in this book. This book is meant to enable readers to gain a 'general knowledge' of one aspect of analog engineering (e.g., that of network theory, filter design, system theory and sampled-data signal processing). The presentation is self-contained and should be accessible to anyone with a first degree in electrical engineering.

                    An Introduction to Logic Circuit Testing provides a detailed coverage of techniques for test generation and testable design of digital electronic circuits/systems. The material covered in the book should be sufficient for a course, or part of a course, in digital circuit testing for senior-level undergraduate and first-year graduate students in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The book will also be a valuable resource for engineers working in the industry. This book has four chapters. Chapter 1 deals with various types of faults that may occur in very large scale integration (VLSI)-based digital circuits. Chapter 2 introduces the major concepts of all test generation techniques such as redundancy, fault coverage, sensitization, and backtracking. Chapter 3 introduces the key concepts of testability, followed by some ad hoc design-for-testability rules that can be used to enhance testability of combinational circuits. Chapter 4 deals with test generation and response evaluation techniques used in BIST (built-in self-test) schemes for VLSI chips.

Asynchronous Operators of Sequential Logic: Venjunction & Sequention: Digital Circuit Analysis and Design ,Vadim Vasyukevich (auth.),https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/34/46/99/34469942e2b11ca3b0fef306b78fbf09.jpg,"
This book is dedicated to new mathematical instruments assigned for logical modeling of the memory of digital devices. The case in point is logic-dynamical operation named venjunction and venjunctive function as well as sequention and sequentional function. Venjunction and sequention operate within the framework of sequential logic. In a form of the corresponding equations, they organically fit analytical expressions of Boolean algebra. Thus, a sort of symbiosis is formed using elements of asynchronous sequential logic on the one hand and combinational logic on the other hand. So, asynchronous logic is represented in the form of enhanced Boolean logic. The book contains initial concepts, fundamental definitions, statements, principles and rules needed for theoretical justification of the mathematical apparatus and its validity for asynchronous logic. Asynchronous operators named venjunctor and sequentor are designed for practical implementation. These basic elements are assigned for realizing of memory functions in sequential circuits. Present research work is the final stage of generalization and systematization of all those ideas and investigations, author’s interest to which alternately flashed up and faded over many years and for various reasons until formed “critical mass”, and all findings were arranged definitively as a mathematical basis of a theory appropriately associated under a common theme – asynchronous sequential logic, essentially classified as switching logic, which falls into category of algebraic logics.

The omnipresence of electronic devices in our everyday lives has been accompanied by the downscaling of chip feature sizes and the ever increasing complexity of digital circuits. This book is devoted to the analysis and design of digital circuits, where the signal can assume only two possible logic levels. It deals with the basic principles and concepts of digital electronics. It addresses all aspects of combinational logic and provides a detailed understanding of logic gates that are the basic components in the implementation of circuits used to perform functions and operations of Boolean algebra. Combinational logic circuits are characterized by outputs that depend only on the actual input values. Efficient techniques to derive logic equations are proposed together with methods of analysis and synthesis of combinational logic circuits. Each chapter is well structured and is supplemented by a selection of solved exercises covering logic design practices. ",https://1lib.in/dl/2836354/b13cf0,276,Wiley-ISTE,2016,english,"PDF, 2.89 MB"

                    The main focus of this book is to provide the reader with a deep understanding of modeling and design strategies of Current-Mode digital circuits, as well as to organize in a coherent manner all the original and powerful authors’ results in the domain of Current-Mode digital circuits.   Model and Design of Bipolar and MOS Current-Mode Logic includes bipolar Current-Mode digital circuits, which emerged as an approach to realize digital circuits with the highest speed, and CMOS Current-Mode digital circuits, which together with its speed performance has been rediscovered to allow logic gates implementations having the feature of low noise level generation.   Model and Design of Bipolar and MOS Current-Mode Logic allows the reader not only to understand the operating principle and the features of bipolar and MOS Current-Mode digital circuits, but also to design optimized digital gates. And, although the material is presented in a formal and theoretical manner, much emphasis is devoted to a design perspective. Moreover, to further link the book’s theoretical aspects with practical issues, and to provide the reader with an idea of the real order of magnitude involved assuming actual technologies, numerical examples together with SPICE simulations are included in the book.  Model and Design of Bipolar and MOS Current-Mode Logic can be used as a reference to practicing engineers working in this area and as text book to senior undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students (already familiar with electronic circuits and logic gates) who want to extend their knowledge and cover all aspects of the analysis and design of Current-Mode digital circuits.

The text ends with an introduction to digital logic design using Verilog, a hardware description language. The chapter on Verilog can be studied along with the other chapters in the text. After the reader has completed combinational logic in Chapters 4 and 5, sections 9.1 and 9.2 would be appropriate. Similarly, the rest of Chapter 9 could be studied after completing sequential logic in Chapters 6 and 7. This short lecture book will be of use to students at any level of electrical or computer engineering and for practicing engineers or scientists in any field looking for a practical and applied introduction to digital logic.

                    Systems are subject to faults in their components, affecting   their overall behaviour. In a 'black-box' system, such faults only become   apparent in the output when appropriate inputs are given, which poses a   number of satisfaction and optimisation problems regarding both testing and   diagnosing. In this dissertation we address such problems, developing   models with multi-valued logics that we formalise and generalise to   multiple faults. Such logics extend Boolean logic by encoding dependencies   on faults, thus allowing the modelling of an arbitrary number of diagnostic   theories. The effectiveness of constraint solving over finite domains and   sets is shown on several of the above problems.

Light and Vacuum presents a synthesis of selected fundamental topics of electromagnetic wave theory and quantum electrodynamics (QED) and analyzes the main theoretical difficulties encountered to ensure a coherent mathematical description of the simultaneous wave–particle nature of light, put in evidence by the experiments. The notion and the role of the quantum vacuum, strongly related to light, are extensively investigated.  Classical electrodynamics issued from Maxwell's equations revealed the necessity of introducing the notion of volume for an electromagnetic wave to stand entailing precise values of cut-off wavelengths to account for the shape and dimensions of the surrounding space. Conversely, in QED, light is considered to be composed of point particles disregarding the conceptual question on how the frequency of oscillating electric and magnetic fields may be attributed to a point particle. To conciliate these concepts, the book provides a comprehensive overview of the author's work, including innovative contributions on the quantization of the vector potential amplitude at a single photon state, the non-local simultaneous wave–particle mathematical representation of the photon and finally the quantum vacuum. The purpose of the advanced elaborations is to raise questions, give hints and answers, and finally aspire for further theoretical and experimental studies in order to improve our knowledge and understanding on the real essence of Light and Vacuum.  In this new edition, the bibliography has been widely enriched. Improvements have been made to the various chapters, taking into account the actual status of the knowledge in this field.

This is not a book for self-study. If you want a self study book (or a light reference), I would recommend using David J. Griffiths book or some other book for introductory EMAG. (The book I originally learned from is no longer in print so I can't really recommend it).
That being said, once you get into chapter 3, the book is excellent. This book also uses the paradigm that solving problems is how you learn the theory. So, as glires noted, much of the proofing is left for you to do in the problems at the end of each chapter.
Also as glires noted, this is not a useful reference. There is no single location where all constants and formulas are listed.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/705908/fae6d3,390,Addison Wesley,1992,english,"DJVU, 27.70 MB"

This book is a self contained course in electromagnetic theory suitable for senior physics and electrical engineering students as well as graduate students whose past has not prepared them well for books such as Jackson or Landau and Lifschitz. The text is liberally sprinkled with worked examples illustrating the application of the theory to various physical problems. This new edition features improved accuracy and readability, added and further clarified examples, plus additional sections on Schwarz-Christoffel mappings. Making the book more self sufficient, an appendix on orthogonal function expansions and the derivation of Bessel functions and Legendre polynomials as well as derivation of their generating functions are each included. The number of exercises has also been increased by 45 over the previous edition. This book stresses the unity of electromagnetic theory with electric and magnetic fields developed in parallel. SI units are used throughout and considerable use is made of tensor notation and the Levi-Cevita symbol. To more closely display the parallelism, extensive use is made of the scalar magnetic potential particularly in dealing with the Laplace and Poisson equation. 85 worked problems illustrate the theory. Conformal mappings are dealt with in some detail. Relevant mathematical material is provided in appendices.

This book provides a new, more accurate and efficient way for design engineers to understand electromagnetic theory and practice as it relates to the shielding of electrical and electronic equipment. The author starts by defining an electromagnetic wave, and goes on to explain the shielding of electromagnetic waves using the basic laws of physics. This is a new approach for the understanding of EMI shielding of barriers, apertures and seams. It provides a reliable, systematic approach that is easily understood by design engineers for the purpose of packaging the electrical and electronic systems of the future. This book covers both theory and practical application, emphasizing the use of transfer impedance to explain fully the penetration of an electromagnetic wave through an EMI gasketed seam. Accurate methods of testing shielding components such as EMI gaskets, shielded cables and connectors, shielded air vent materials, conductive glass and conductive paint are also covered.Describes in detail why the currently accepted theory of shielding needs improvement.Discusses the penetration of an electromagnetic wave through shielding barrier materials and electromagnetic interference (EMI) gasketed seams.Emphasizes the use of transfer impedance to explain the penetration of an electromagnetic wave through an EMI gasketed seam.The definition of an electromagnetic wave and how it is generated is included.Chapter in the book are included that reinforce the presented theory.

Engineers and scientists who develop and install electronic devices and circuits need to have a solid understanding of electromagnetic theory and the electromagnetic behavior of devices and circuits. In particular, they must be well-versed in electromagnetic compatibility, which minimizes and controls the side effects of interconnected electric devices.  Designed to entice the practical engineer to explore some worthwhile mathematical methods, and to reorient the theoretical scientist to industrial applications, Electromagnetic Theory for Electromagnetic Compatibility Engineers is based on the author’s courses taught in industrial settings. The book is a mathematically rigorous exposition of electromagnetic theory with applications in electromagnetic compatibility and high-speed digital design.   The topics—ranging from Maxwell's theory and multi-conductor transmission line theory to S-matrix, antenna theory, and dielectric breakdown—were chosen because they have direct relevance to current electromagnetic compatibility problems encountered in the real world. With many worked examples and problem sets, the book relates the theory to practical experiences faced by practitioners. It is written both for physicists and mathematicians new to the field of electromagnetic compatibility and high-speed digital design, as well as established researchers in the field. It is also designed as an advanced undergraduate textbook for a course in electromagnetic theory. ",https://1lib.in/dl/2328055/784eda,,CRC Press,2013,english,"PDF, 7.20 MB"

Basic Electromagnetic Theoryis designed as a concise introduction to electromagnetic field theory emphasizing the physical foundations of the subject. It is aimed at both undergraduates and interested laypersons. It has been based on the author's experience both as a former field theorist (working on quantum electrodynamics) and currently as an applied optical physicist. As such, it covers much material from the standard university syllabus. It also develops a number of themes in greater detail, so as to cover a number of non-standard topics that provide a fuller understanding of the subject. A key aspect to the book is the macroscopic approach to the subject from the outset. Most readers will have some familiarity with the standard mathematics employed, but a review chapter is provided at the beginning to help give some guidance on these topics as they are used throughout the book.Features:-Designed as a concise introduction to electromagnetic field theory emphasizing the physical foundations of the subject-Covers a number of non-standard topics that provide a fuller understanding of the subject ",https://1lib.in/dl/3705322/484f90,176,Mercury Learning & Information,2016,english,"EPUB, 11.20 MB"

This book, Electronic Devices and Circuit Application, is the first of four books of a larger work, Fundamentals of Electronics. It is comprised of four chapters describing the basic operation of each of the four fundamental building blocks of modern electronics: operational amplifiers, semiconductor diodes, bipolar junction transistors, and field effect transistors. Attention is focused on the reader obtaining a clear understanding of each of the devices when it is operated in equilibrium. Ideas fundamental to the study of electronic circuits are also developed in the book at a basic level to lessen the possibility of misunderstandings at a higher level. The difference between linear and non-linear operation is explored through the use of a variety of circuit examples including amplifiers constructed with operational amplifiers as the fundamental component and elementary digital logic gates constructed with various transistor types. Fundamentals of Electronics has been designed primarily for use in an upper division course in electronics for electrical engineering students. Typically such a course spans a full academic years consisting of two semesters or three quarters. As such, Electronic Devices and Circuit Applications, and the following two books, Amplifiers: Analysis and Design and Active Filters and Amplifier Frequency Response, form an appropriate body of material for such a course. Secondary applications include the use in a one-semester electronics course for engineers or as a reference for practicing engineers.

                    PSpice for Circuit Theory and Electronic Devices is one of a series of five PSpice books and introduces the latest Cadence Orcad PSpice version 10.5 by simulating a range of DC and AC exercises. It is aimed primarily at those wishing to get up to speed with this version but will be of use to high school students, undergraduate students, and of course, lecturers. Circuit theorems are applied to a range of circuits and the calculations by hand after analysis are then compared to the simulated results. The Laplace transform and the s-plane are used to analyze CR and LR circuits where transient signals are involved. Here, the Probe output graphs demonstrate what a great learning tool PSpice is by providing the reader with a visual verification of any theoretical calculations. Series and parallel-tuned resonant circuits are investigated where the difficult concepts of dynamic impedance and selectivity are best understood by sweeping different circuit parameters through a range of values.    Obtaining semiconductor device characteristics as a laboratory exercise has fallen out of favour of late, but nevertheless, is still a useful exercise for understanding or modelling semiconductor devices. Inverting and non-inverting operational amplifiers characteristics such as gain-bandwidth are investigated and we will see the dependency of bandwidth on the gain using the performance analysis facility. Power amplifiers are examined where PSpice/Probe demonstrates very nicely the problems of cross-over distortion and other problems associated with power transistors. We examine power supplies and the problems of regulation, ground bounce, and power factor correction. Lastly, we look at MOSFET device characteristics and show how these devices are used to form basic CMOS logic gates such as NAND and NOR gates.

Except for digressions in Chapters 8 and 17, this book is a highly unified treatment of simple oscillations and waves. The phenomena treated are ""simple"" in that they are de­ scribable by linear equations, almost all occur in one dimension, and the dependent variables are scalars instead of vectors or something else (such as electromagnetic waves) with geometric complications. The book omits such complicated cases in order to deal thoroughly with properties shared by all linear os­ cillations and waves. The first seven chapters are a sequential treatment of electrical and mechanical oscillating systems, starting with the simplest and proceeding to systems of coupled oscillators subjected to ar­ bitrary driving forces. Then, after a brief discussion of nonlinear oscillations in Chapter 8, the concept of normal modes of motion is introduced and used to show the relationship between os­ cillations and waves. After Chapter 12, properties of waves are explored by whatever mathematical techniques are applicable. The book ends with a short discussion of three-dimensional vii viii Preface problems (in Chapter 16), and a study of a few aspects of non­ linear waves (in Chapter 17).

Electromagnetic Field Interaction with Transmission Lines : From Classical Theory to HF Radiation Effects (Advances in Electrical Engineering and Electromagnetics) ,F. Rachidi,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/44/ad/34/44ad343cb536585fc616eaafcc7de5e5.jpg,"
                    The evaluation of electromagnetic field coupling to transmission lines is animportant problem in electromagnetic compatibility. The use of the transmission line (TL) approximation theory has permitted the solution of a large range of problems (e. g. lightning and EMP interaction with power lines). However, the continual increase in operating frequency of products and higher-frequency sources of disturbances (such as UWB systems) makes TL basic assumptions no longer acceptable for a certain number of applications. In the last decade or so, the generalization of classical TL theory to take into account high frequency effects has emerged as an important topic of study in electromagnetic compatibility. This effort resulted in the elaboration ofthe so-called ""generalized"" or ""full-wave"" TL theory, which incorporates high frequency radiation effects, while keeping the relative simplicity of TL equations.This book is organized in two main parts. Part I presents consolidatedknowledge of classical transmission line theory and differentfield-to-transmission line coupling models. Part II presents differentapproaches developed to generalize TL Theory.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/1227911/bbabf2,280,WIT Press / Computational Mechanics,2008,english,"PDF, 3.96 MB"

The revised edition presents, extends, and updates a thorough analysis of the factors that cause and accelerate the aging of conductive and insulating materials of which transmission and distribution electrical apparatus is made. New sections in the second edition summarize the issues of the aging, reliability, and safety of electrical apparatus, as well as supporting equipment in the field of generating renewable energy (solar, wind, tide, and wave power). When exposed to atmospheric corrosive gases and fluids, contaminants, high and low temperatures, vibrations, and other internal and external impacts, these systems deteriorate; eventually the ability of the apparatus to function properly is destroyed. In the modern world of ""green energy"", the equipment providing clean, electrical energy needs to be properly maintained in order to prevent premature failure. The book’s purpose is to help find the proper ways to slow down the aging of electrical apparatus, improve its performance, and extend the life of power generation, transmission, and distribution equipment.

                    The excitement and the glitz of mechatronics has shifted the engineering community’s attention away from fluid power systems in recent years. However, fluid power still remains advantageous in many applications compared to electrical or mechanical power transmission methods. Designers are left with few practical resources to help in the design and analysis of fluid power systems, especially when approaching fluid power for the first time.
Helping you overcome these hurdles, Hydraulic Power System Analysis demonstrates modern computer-aided analytical techniques used to model nonlinear, dynamic fluid power systems. Following an overview of fluid power, the authors examine various relevant fluid properties, energy calculations, and steady state and dynamic analysis along with a review of automatic control theory. Turning to modeling, the next few chapters address valves and motors and then apply dynamic modeling to examples relating to pumps, hydrostatic transmissions, and valves. The book includes a unique chapter showing how to combine flow resistance equations with the differential equations governing dynamic system performance. The final chapter translates electrical circuit theory concepts to noise attenuation in fluid power systems.
Illustrated with many equations, practical computer modeling examples, and exercises, Hydraulic Power System Analysis provides a much-needed modernization of dynamic modeling for fluid power systems using powerful computational tools.

                    2003. , third edition, 694 pages. A lot of worked-out examples, including MATLAB codes.Note: Book obtained as a kind gift of Raj (user Raj).Preface to the Third EditionSince the appearance of the second edition in 1989, the overall energy situation has changed considerably and this has generated great interest in non-conventional and renewable energy sources, energy conservation and management, power reforms and restructuring and distributed and dispersed generation. Chapter 1 has been therefore, enlarged and completely rewritten. In addition, the influences of environmental constraints are also discussed.The present edition, like the earlier two, is designed for a two-semester course at the undergraduate level or for first-semester post-graduate study.Modern power systems have grown larger and spread over larger geographical area with many interconnections between neighbouring systems. Optimal planning, operation and control of such large-scale systems require advanced computer-based techniques many of which are explained in the student-oriented and reader-friendly manner by means of numerical examples throughout this book. Electric utility engineers will also be benefitted by the book as it will prepare them more adequately to face the new challenges. The style of writing is amenable to self-study. The wide range of topics facilitates versatile selection of chapters and sections for completion in the semester time frame.Highlights of this edition are the five new chapters. Chapter 13 deals with power system security. Contingency analysis and sensitivity factors are described. An analytical framework is developed to control bulk power systems in such a way that security is enhanced. Everything seems to have a propensity to fail. Power systems are no exception. Power system security practices try to control and operate power systems in a defensive posture so that the effects of these inevitable failures are minimized.Chapter 14 is an introduction to the use of state estimation in electric power systems. We have selected Least Squares Estimation to give basic solution. External system equivalencing and treatment of bad data are also discussed.The economics of power transmission has always lured the planners to transmit as much power as possible through existing transmission lines. Difficulty of acquiring the right of way for new lines (the corridor crisis) has always motivated the power engineers to develop compensatory systems. Therefore, Chapter 15 addresses compensation in power systems. Both series and shunt compensation of lines have been thoroughly discussed. Concepts of SVS, STATCOM and FACTS have-been briefly introduced.Chapter 16 covers the important topic of load forecasting technique. Knowing load is absolutely essential for solving any power system problem.Chapter 17 deals with the important problem of voltage stability. Mathematical formulation, analysis, state-of-art, future trends and challenges are discussed.MATLAB and SIMULINK, ideal programs for power system analysis are included in this book as an appendix along with 18 solved examples illustrating their use in solving representative power system problems.

This is the third volume in a trilogy on modern Signal Processing. The three books provide a concise exposition of signal processing topics, and a guide to support individual practical exploration based on MATLAB programs.This book includes MATLAB codes to illustrate each of the main steps of the theory, offering a self-contained guide suitable for independent study. The code is embedded in the text, helping readers to put into practice the ideas and methods discussed.The book primarily focuses on filter banks, wavelets, and images. While the Fourier transform is adequate for periodic signals, wavelets are more suitable for other cases, such as short-duration signals: bursts, spikes, tweets, lung sounds, etc. Both Fourier and wavelet transforms decompose signals into components. Further, both are also invertible, so the original signals can be recovered from their components. Compressed sensing has emerged as a promising idea. One of the intended applications is networked devices or sensors, which are now becoming a reality; accordingly, this topic is also addressed. A selection of experiments that demonstrate image denoising applications are also included. In the interest of reader-friendliness, the longer programs have been grouped in an appendix; further, a second appendix on optimization has been added to supplement the content of the last chapter.

This book introduces simulation tools and strategies for complex systems of solid-state-drives (SSDs) which consist of a flash multi-core microcontroller plus NAND flash memories. It provides a broad overview of the most popular simulation tools, with special focus on open source solutions. VSSIM, NANDFlashSim and DiskSim are benchmarked against performances of real SSDs under different traffic workloads. PROs and CONs of each simulator are analyzed, and it is clearly indicated which kind of answers each of them can give and at a what price. It is explained, that speed and precision do not go hand in hand, and it is important to understand when to simulate what, and with which tool. Being able to simulate SSD’s performances is mandatory to meet time-to-market, together with product cost and quality. Over the last few years the authors developed an advanced simulator named “SSDExplorer” which has been used to evaluate multiple phenomena with great accuracy, from QoS (Quality Of Service) to Read Retry, from LDPC Soft Information to power, from Flash aging to FTL. SSD simulators are also addressed in a broader context in this book, i.e. the analysis of what happens when SSDs are connected to the OS (Operating System) and to the end-user application (for example, a database search). The authors walk the reader through the full simulation flow of a real system-level by combining SSD Explorer with the QEMU virtual platform. The reader will be impressed by the level of know-how and the combination of models that such simulations are asking for.

                    This book explores the implementation of MATLAB(R) and Simulink(R) in the development of embedded robust control systems. Robust control theory allows for changes in a system whilst maintaining stability and performance. Applications of this technique are very important for dependable embedded systems, making technologies such as drones and other autonomous systems with sophisticated embedded controllers and systems relatively common-place.Three extended case studies are developed in depth: embedded control of a tank physical model; robust control of a miniature helicopter; and robust control of two-wheeled robots. These are taken from the area of motion control but the book may be also used by designers in other areas.Some knowledge of linear control theory is assumed and experience of C programming is desirable but to make the book accessible to engineers new to the field and to students, the authors avoid complicated mathematical proofs and overwhelming computer architecture technical details. All programs used in the examples and case studies will be freely downloadable to help with the assimilation of the book contents.This book is essential reading for engineers, developers, designers, industrial practitioners, scientists, and researchers in Control, Automation, Robotics, Mechatronics, Mechanical Engineering, Computing, and Electronics (with a focus on robust control systems and the design, modelling and implementation of embedded systems).

Embedded Systems: Real-Time Interfacing to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers,Jonathan Valvano,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/8c/63/13/8c631303dd797b0ce375121e266d4df1.jpg,"
                    This book, now in its fourth edition, is the second in a series of three books that teach the fundamentals of embedded systems as applied to ARM® Cortex™-M microcontrollers. The three books are primarily written for undergraduate electrical and computer engineering students. They could also be used for professionals learning the ARM platform. The first book Embedded Systems: Introduction to ARM® Cortex™-M Microcontrollers is an introduction to computers and interfacing focusing on assembly language and C programming. This second book focuses on interfacing and the design of embedded systems. The third book Embedded Systems: Real-Time Operating Systems for ARM® Cortex™-M Microcontrollers is an advanced book focusing on operating systems, high-speed interfacing, control systems, and robotics.   An embedded system is a system that performs a specific task and has a computer embedded inside. Topics include microcontrollers, design, verification, hardware/software synchronization, interfacing devices to the computer, timing diagrams, real-time systems, data collection and processing, motor control, analog filters, digital filters, and real-time signal processing.In general, the area of embedded systems is an important and growing discipline within electrical and computer engineering. The educational market of embedded system is dominated by simple microcontrollers like the PIC, 9S12, and 8051. This is because of their market share, low cost, and historical dominance. However, as problems become more complex, so must the systems that solve them. A number of embedded system paradigms must shift in order to accommodate this growth in complexity. First, the number of calculations per second will increase from about 1 million/sec to 1 billion/sec. Similarly, the number of lines of software code will also increase from 1000’s to 10 to 100 million. Thirdly, systems will involve multiple microcontrollers supporting many simultaneous operations. Lastly, the need for system verification will continue to grow as these systems are deployed into safety critical applications. These changes are more than a simple growth in size and bandwidth. These systems must employ parallel programming, DMA synchronization, real-time operating systems, fault tolerant design, priority interrupt handling, and networking. Consequently, it will be important to provide our students with these types of design experiences. The ARM platform is both low cost and provides the high performance features required in future embedded systems. The ARM market share is currently large and growing. Furthermore, students trained on the ARM will be equipped to design systems across the complete spectrum from simple to complex. The purpose of writing this book at this time is to bring engineering education into the 21st century.This book employs many approaches to learning. It will not include an exhaustive recapitulation of the information in data sheets. First, it begins with basic fundamentals, which allows the reader to solve new problems with new technology. Second, the book presents many detailed design examples. These examples illustrate the process of design. There are multiple structural components that assist learning. Checkpoints, with answers in the back, are short easy to answer questions providing immediate feedback while reading.

Initial material for this book was developed over a period of several years through the introduction in the mid-seventies of a graduate-level course en­ titled, ""Control and Operation of Interconnected Power Systems,"" at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Subsequent involvement with the utility industry and in teaching continuing education courses on modern power sys­ tem control and operation contributed to the complimentary treatment of the dynamic aspects of this overall topic. In effect, we have evolved a textbook that provides a thorough under­ standing of fudamentals as needed by a graduate student with a prior back­ ground in power systems analysis at the undergraduate level, and in system theory concepts normally provided at the beginning of the graduate level in electrical engineering. It is also designed to provide the depth needed both by the serious graduate student and the power industry engineer involved in the activities of energy control centers and short-term operations planning. As explained in Chapter 2, the entire book can be covered in a two­ quarter course sequence. The bulk of the material may be covered in one semester. For a two-semester offering, we recommend that students be in­ volved in some project work to further their depth of understanding. Utility and consulting industry engineers should concentrate on the more advanced concepts and developments usually available at the latter half of each chap­ ter.

                    Renewable Energy (RE) sources differ from conventional sources in that, generally they cannot be scheduled, they are much smaller than conventional power stations and are often connected to the electricity distribution system rather than the transmission system.  The integration of such time variable ‘distributed’ or ‘embedded’ sources into electricity networks requires special consideration. This new book addresses these special issues and covers the following:The characteristics of conventional and RE generators with particular reference to the variable nature of RE from wind, solar, small hydro and marine sources over time scales ranging from seconds to monthsThe power balance and frequency stability in a network with increasing inputs from variable sources and the technical and economic implications of increased penetration from such sources  with special reference to demand side managementThe conversion of energy into electricity from RE sources and the type and characteristics of generators usedThe requirement to condition the power from RE sources and the type and mode of operation of the power electronic converters used to interface such generators to the gridThe flow of power over networks supplied from conventional plus RE sources with particular reference to voltage control and protectionThe economics and trading of ‘green’ electricity in national and international deregulated marketsThe expected developments in RE technology and the future shape of power systems where the penetration from RE sources is large and where substantial operational and control benefits will be   derived from extensive use of power electronic interfaces and controllersThe text is designed to be intelligible to readers who have little previous knowledge of electrical engineering. The more analytical electrical aspects are relegated to an Appendix for readers who wish to gain a more in depth  understanding. The book’s flexible structure makes its accessible to the general engineer or scientists but also caters for readers with a non-scientific background. Economists, planners and environmental specialists will find parts of the book informative.                 ",https://1lib.in/dl/846812/2804f8,300,,2008,english,"PDF, 6.32 MB"

This book features cutting-edge research presented at the second international conference on Artificial Intelligence in Renewable Energetic Systems, IC-AIRES2018, held on 24–26 November 2018, at the High School of Commerce, ESC-Koléa in Tipaza, Algeria. Today, the fundamental challenge of integrating renewable energies into the design of smart cities is more relevant than ever. While based on the advent of big data and the use of information and communication technologies, smart cities must now respond to cross-cutting issues involving urban development, energy and environmental constraints; further, these cities must also explore how they can integrate more sustainable energies. Sustainable energies are a major determinant of smart cities’ longevity. From an environmental and technological standpoint, these energies offer an optimal power supply to the electric network while creating significantly less pollution. This requires flexibility, i.e., the availability of supply and demand. The end goal of any smart city is to improve the quality of life for all citizens (both in the city and in the countryside) in a way that is sustainable and respectful of the environment. This book encourages the reader to engage in the preservation of our environment, every moment, every day, so as to help build a clean and healthy future, and to think of the future generations who will one day inherit our planet. Further, it equips those whose work involves energy systems and those engaged in modelling artificial intelligence to combine their expertise for the benefit of the scientific community and humanity as a whole.

The book looks at Earth from the perspective of a livable planet and elaborates the surface and subsurface processes and the various energy cycles where energy is transformed and stored in the planet's various spheres. The chapters discuss the interactions between the different parts of Earth-how energy is exchanged between the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere, and how they impact the environment in which we live. Beginning with an introduction that highlights the strong nexus between Earth, energy, and environment through connectivity and interactivity of natural processes that influence the sustainability of life, the book goes on to discuss Earth in particular-its origin and evolution, its surfaces and rock-forming processes, in the context of past climates, climate changes, and influencing planetary cycles. The volume then focuses on energy-its fundamentals and its various forms. The authors cover conventional and unconventional fossil fuels and renewables and the aspects of energy availability and economics. The fact that energy is central to life and its activities is elaborated in the included chapters. This section reinforces the connection between different energy forms with Earth's surface and subsurface processes. The final section examines the environment- its impact on human health and well-being, climate change and resulting environmental impacts, environmental disasters from exploration, production and usage of energy, and balancing energy usage and its environmental impacts. This holistic approach to the integrated science of earth, energy and environment provides a comprehensive and all-around understanding of the complex planet that is home to mankind. The book is particularly intended for those studying introductory earth sciences, energy fundamentals, and environmental studies.

Before SSL VPN this typically required the client machine to have special software installed, or at least be specially configured for the purpose. Clientless SSL VPNs avoid the need for client machines to be specially configured. Any computer with a Web browser can access SSL VPN systems. This has several benefits:  Low admin costs, no remote configurationUsers can safely access the company network from any machine, be that a public workstation, a palmtop or mobile phoneBy pass ISP restrictions on custom VPNs by using standard technologies  SSL VPN is usually provided by a hardware appliance that forms part of the company network. These appliances act as gateways, providing internal services such as file shares, email servers, and applications in a web based format encrypted using SSL. Existing players and new entrants, such as Nokia, Netilla, Symantec, Whale Communications, and NetScreen technologies, are rushing our SSL VPN products to meet growing demand.   This book provides a detailed technical and business introduction to SSL VPN. It explains how SSL VPN devices work along with their benefits and pitfalls. As well as covering SSL VPN technologies, the book also looks at how to authenticate and educate users ? a vital element in ensuring that the security of remote locations is not compromised. The book also looks at strategies for making legacy applications accessible via the SSL VPN.   What you will learn from this book?   How SSL VPN technology works, and how it fits into existing network architectures Evaluating SSL VPN for your organization Understand what to look out for when talking to vendors How to plan an SSL VPN implementation for your business Educate staff to maintain SSL VPN securityStrategies for providing access to internal legacy applications via SSL VPNA heads-up on likely trends and possibilities for the future of SSL VPN Approach   The book blends technically rigorous descriptions with a friendly approach based on practical examples and scenarios. The authors write in clear, informal language and make extensive use of diagrams and images. The book begins with an overview of SSL VPN?s purpose, and the technical and business trends that are making it popular today. It then looks at how SSL VPNs work and how they fit into existing network plans. The effect of SSL VPN on the wider business environment is then considered, before looking at how SSL VPN technology is likely to develop in the future.   Who this book is written for?    This book aimed at IT network professionals and managers who are currently evaluating SSL VPN technologies. It requires a broad understanding of networking concepts, but does not require specific and detailed technical knowledge of protocols or vendor implementations.

                    Web technologies are increasingly relevant to scientists working with data, for both accessing data and creating rich dynamic and interactive displays. The XML and JSON data formats are widely used in Web services, regular Web pages and javascript code, and visualization formats such as SVG and KML for Google Earth and Google Maps. In addition, scientists use HTTP and other network protocols to scrape data from Web pages, access REST and SOAP Web Services, and interact with NoSQL databases and text search applications. This book provides a practical hands-on introduction to these technologies, including high-level functions the authors have developed for data scientists. It describes strategies and approaches for extracting data from HTML, XML, and JSON formats and how to programmatically access data from the Web.Along with these general skills, the authors illustrate several applications that are relevant to data scientists, such as reading and writing spreadsheet documents both locally and via Google Docs, creating interactive and dynamic visualizations, displaying spatial-temporal displays with Google Earth, and generating code from descriptions of data structures to read and write data. These topics demonstrate the rich possibilities and opportunities to do new things with these modern technologies. The book contains many examples and case-studies that readers can use directly and adapt to their own work. The authors have focused on the integration of these technologies with the R statistical computing environment. However, the ideas and skills presented here are more general, and statisticians who use other computing environments will also find them relevant to their work.

Blockchain is no longer just about bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general. Instead, it can be seen as a disruptive, revolutionary technology which will have major impacts on multiple aspects of our lives. The revolutionary power of such technology compares with the revolution sparked by the World Wide Web and the Internet in general. Just as the Internet is a means of sharing information, so blockchain technologies can be seen as a way to introduce the next level: sharing value.  Blockchain and Web 3.0 fills the gap in our understanding of blockchain technologies by hosting a discussion of the new technologies in a variety of disciplinary settings. Indeed, this volume explains how such technologies are disruptive and comparatively examines the social, economic, technological and legal consequences of these disruptions. Such a comparative perspective has previously been underemphasized in the debate about blockchain, which has subsequently led to weaknesses in our understanding of decentralized technologies.  Underlining the risks and opportunities offered by the advent of blockchain technologies and the rise of Web 3.0, Blockchain and Web 3.0 will appeal to researchers and academics interested in fields such as sociology and social policy, cyberculture, new media and privacy and data protection.

                    A project-based guide to the basics of deep learning.

This concise, project-driven guide to deep learning takes readers through a series of program-writing tasks that introduce them to the use of deep learning in such areas of artificial intelligence as computer vision, natural-language processing, and reinforcement learning. The author, a longtime artificial intelligence researcher specializing in natural-language processing, covers feed-forward neural nets, convolutional neural nets, word embeddings, recurrent neural nets, sequence-to-sequence learning, deep reinforcement learning, unsupervised models, and other fundamental concepts and techniques. Students and practitioners learn the basics of deep learning by working through programs in Tensorflow, an open-source machine learning framework. “I find I learn computer science material best by sitting down and writing programs,” the author writes, and the book reflects this approach.

Each chapter includes a programming project, exercises, and references for further reading. An early chapter is devoted to Tensorflow and its interface with Python, the widely used programming language. Familiarity with linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and probability and statistics is required, as is a rudimentary knowledge of programming in Python.

Business Intelligence Strategy and Big Data Analytics is written for business leaders, managers, and analysts - people who are involved with advancing the use of BI at their companies or who need to better understand what BI is and how it can be used to improve profitability.  It is written from a general management perspective, and it draws on observations at 12 companies whose annual revenues range between $500 million and $20 billion.  Over the past 15 years, my company has formulated vendor-neutral business-focused BI strategies and program execution plans in collaboration with manufacturers, distributors, retailers, logistics companies, insurers, investment companies, credit unions, and utilities, among others.  It is through these experiences that we have validated business-driven BI strategy formulation methods and identified common enterprise BI program execution challenges. In recent years, terms like “big data and “big data analytics have been introduced into the business and technical lexicon.  Upon close examination, the newer terminology is about the same thing that BI has always been about: analyzing the vast amounts of data that companies generate and/or purchase in the course of business as a means of improving profitability and competitiveness.  Accordingly, we will use the terms BI and business intelligence throughout the book, and we will discuss the newer concepts like big data as appropriate.  More broadly, the goal of this book is to share methods and observations that will help companies achieve BI success and thereby increase revenues, reduce costs, or both.Provides ideas for improving the business performance of one’s company or business functionsEmphasizes proven, practical, step-by-step methods that readers can readily apply in their companiesIncludes exercises and case studies with road-tested advice about formulating BI strategies and program plans ",https://1lib.in/dl/2800978/28b6d5,240,Morgan Kaufmann,2016,english,"PDF, 6.07 MB"

Every day, engineers and managers are called upon to understand and execute the terms of construction contracts. Often, these professionals have little or no legal training and find themselves relying upon intuition, common sense or hearsay—with possibly unfortunate and expensive results.In Interpreting Construction Contracts, Thomas and Ellis seek to rescue contractors, project managers, and contract administrators struggling to interpret construction contracts. Using rules set forth by the judiciary and drawing upon decades of legal research and practical experience, the authors discuss the most troublesome contract clauses and present rules to construe them so as to avoid disputes that must be resolved in court. Diagrams, case studies, and more than 70 discussion exercises and solutions are provided to reinforce the principles introduced in each chapter.As clear as it is pragmatic, Interpreting Construction Contracts is a welcome teaching resource and an essential reference for engineers and managers working in the construction industry.

                    Corporate finance theory seeks to understand how incorporated firms address the financial constraints that affect their investment decisions. This is achieved by using varied financial instruments that give holders different claims on the firm's assets. Recent scholarship in this area explores precisely how legal mechanisms affect corporate finance and the development of financial markets. The legal environment is crucially important in explaining the choices that companies make about their capital structure.This book combines company law, capital market regulation and commercial law to give readers a detailed understanding of the legal and regulatory issues relating to corporate financial transactions. Informed by insights from the theoretical and empirical work of financial economists, the book examines, from a legal perspective, key elements of corporate financing structures and capital markets in the UK. The authors' practical experience of transactions and regulatory issues ensures that thorough scholarly inquiry and critical reflection are complemented by an assured understanding of the interface between legal principles and rules as they are documented and in their actual operation.

The key topics of each chapter demonstrate a variety of fundamental issues in the supply chain industry: What are supply chain markets? What is the supply chain cost structure? What are supply chain strategies? How do supply chain firms design and implement strategies? What are the key roles of logistics service providers, logistics education operators and logistics associations? How should supply chain operations be managed? How is a sustainable and innovative supply chain structure created? Comparative practical case studies from Asia, North America and Latin America lend weight to the chapters.

Advanced Engineering Mathematics with MATLAB, Fourth Edition builds upon three successful previous editions. It is written for today’s STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) student. Three assumptions under lie its structure: (1) All students need a firm grasp of the traditional disciplines of ordinary and partial differential equations, vector calculus and linear algebra. (2) The modern student must have a strong foundation in transform methods because they provide the mathematical basis for electrical and communication studies. (3) The biological revolution requires an understanding of stochastic (random) processes. The chapter on Complex Variables, positioned as the first chapter in previous editions, is now moved to Chapter 10. The author employs MATLAB to reinforce concepts and solve problems that require heavy computation. Along with several updates and changes from the third edition, the text continues to evolve to meet the needs of today’s instructors and students.

There is a large gap between the engineering course in tensor algebra on the one hand and the treatment of linear transformations within classical linear algebra on the other hand. The aim of the book is to bridge this gap by means of the consequent and fundamental exposition. The book is addressed primarily to engineering students with some initial knowledge of matrix algebra. Thereby the mathematical formalism is applied as far as it is absolutely necessary. Numerous exercises provided in the book are accompanied by solutions enabling an autonomous study. The last chapters of the book deal with modern developments in the theory of isotropic an anisotropic tensor functions and their applications to continuum mechanics and might therefore be of high interest for PhD-students and scientists working in this area.  In the last decades, the absolute notation for tensors has become widely accepted and is now a current state of the art for publications in solid and structural mechanics. This is opposed to a majority of books on tensor calculus referring to index notation. The latter one complicates the understanding of the matter especially for readers with initial knowledge. Thus, this book aims at being a modern textbook on tensor calculus for engineers in line with the contemporary way of scientific publications.

                    This book explores the implementation of MATLAB(R) and Simulink(R) in the development of embedded robust control systems. Robust control theory allows for changes in a system whilst maintaining stability and performance. Applications of this technique are very important for dependable embedded systems, making technologies such as drones and other autonomous systems with sophisticated embedded controllers and systems relatively common-place.Three extended case studies are developed in depth: embedded control of a tank physical model; robust control of a miniature helicopter; and robust control of two-wheeled robots. These are taken from the area of motion control but the book may be also used by designers in other areas.Some knowledge of linear control theory is assumed and experience of C programming is desirable but to make the book accessible to engineers new to the field and to students, the authors avoid complicated mathematical proofs and overwhelming computer architecture technical details. All programs used in the examples and case studies will be freely downloadable to help with the assimilation of the book contents.This book is essential reading for engineers, developers, designers, industrial practitioners, scientists, and researchers in Control, Automation, Robotics, Mechatronics, Mechanical Engineering, Computing, and Electronics (with a focus on robust control systems and the design, modelling and implementation of embedded systems).

                    In Chemical Engineering Dynamics, the modelling of dynamic chemical engineering processes is presented in a highly understandable way using the unique combination of simplified fundamental theory and direct hands-on computer simulation. The mathematics is kept to a minimum, and yet the nearly 100 examples supplied on a CD-ROM illustrate almost every aspect of chemical engineering science. Each example is described in detail, including the model equations. They are written in the modern user-friendly simulation language Berkeley Madonna, which can be run on both Windows PC and Power-Macintosh computers.Madonna solves models comprising many ordinary differential equations using very simple programming, including arrays. It is so powerful that the model parameters may be defined as ""sliders"", which allow the effect of their change on the model behavior to be seen almost immediately. Data may be included for curve fitting, and sensitivity or multiple runs may be performed. The results can be seen simultaneously on multiple-graph windows or by using overlays. The resultant learning effect of this is tremendous. The examples can be varied to fit any real situation, and the suggested exercises provide practical guidance.The extensive experience of the authors, both in university teaching and international courses, is reflected in this well-balanced presentation, which is suitable for the teacher, the student, the chemist or the engineer. This book provides a greater understanding of the formulation and use of mass and energy balances for chemical engineering, in a most stimulating manner.

                    The idea that “thoughts become things” has become a meme in popular culture. It’s held as a firm proposition in metaphysics, and some spiritual teachers ascribe infinite powers to the mind. But are these claims scientifically accurate? What does the scientific evidence tell us about the scope of the human mind to transform thoughts into reality?New research and new discoveries in epigenetics, neuroscience, electromagnetism, psychology, cymatics (the study of wave phenomena), public health, and quantum physics are demonstrating that thoughts can indeed be profoundly creative. InMind to Matter, award-winning author Dawson Church examines the scientific facts and reviews the studies that show, step by step, exactly how our minds create material form. As each piece of the puzzle falls into place, the science turns out to be even more astonishing than the metaphysics.Throughout the book, Church shares illuminating case histories—up-close, authentic personal accounts of people who had an experience of turning mind into matter. Drawn from the worlds of medicine, sports, business, healing, art, and scientific discovery, these stories run the gamut from profound to inspiring to heart-wrenching. Meticulously researched evidence is presented in highly relatable form, using engaging, understandable, nontechnical analogies. Photos and illustrations enrich the text.As we discover how the universe operates synchronistically, we come to understand that while we have individual local minds, we also participate in universal nonlocal mind.Mind to Mattershows us that as we take charge of our individual power to create, we have the potential, as a species, to catalyze a transformation of our whole world.

Job Hazard Analysis: A Guide for Voluntary Compliance and Beyond, Second Edition, provides a complete reference for performing JHA and setting up a JHA program. The book identifies the basic job steps and tasks, their associated hazards and risks, and safe operating procedures and hazard controls based on this analysis. Authors James Roughton and Nathan Crutchfield argue that the JHA should be the centerpiece of any risk control and occupational safety and health program. However, the traditional JHA has potential problems in gathering and analysis of task data and, with its focus on the sequence of steps, can miss the behavioral effects and the systems interactions between tools, equipment, materials, work environment, management and the individual worker.The concepts are presented for the JHA, incorporating elements from Behavior-Based Safety and Six Sigma. Readers are taken through the whole process of developing tools for identifying workplace hazards, developing systems that support hazard recognition, developing an effective JHA, and managing a JHA based program that can be easily incorporated into occupational safety and health management systems, thus allowing businesses to move from mere compliance to a pro-active safety management. The book is supported by numerous examples of JHAs, end of chapter review questions, sample checklists, action plans, and forms.Provides a basic understanding of the JHA process and a more in-depth background on the human performance improvement for a successful JHA program implementationMethodically develops the risk assessment basics needed within the JHA processPresents expanded resources that are useful in safety systemsIncorporates elements from Behavior-Based Safety and Six Sigma ",https://1lib.in/dl/2716436/c60d3f,504,"Elsevier, Butterworth-Heinemann",2016,english,"PDF, 43.94 MB"

Coverage ranged from pure elements to superalloys, from glasses to engineering ceramics, and from everyday plastics to in situ composites, Amongst other favourable reviews, Professor Bhadeshia of Cambridge University commented: ""Given the amount of work that has obviously gone into this book and its extensive comments, it is very attractively priced. It is an excellent book to be recommend strongly for purchase by undergraduates in materials-related subjects, who should benefit greatly by owning a text containing so much knowledge.The book now includes new chapters on materials for sports equipment (golf, tennis, bicycles, skiing, etc.) and biomaterials (replacement joints, heart valves, tissue repair, etc.) - two of the most exciting and rewarding areas in current materials research and development. As in its predecessor, numerous examples are given of the ways in which knowledge of the relation between fine structure and properties has made it possible to optimise the service behaviour of traditional engineering materials and to develop completely new and exciting classes of materials. Special consideration is given to the crucial processing stage that enables materials to be produced as marketable commodities. Whilst attempting to produce a useful and relatively concise survey of key materials and their interrelationships, the authors have tried to make the subject accessible to a wide range of readers, to provide insights into specialised methods of examination and to convey the excitement of the atmosphere in which new materials are conceived and developed.

                    A complete introduction to Sanatana Dharma, the spiritual science of the Hindu sages  • Examines how many core concepts of Hinduism, including Brahman, Atman, bhakti, karma, and reincarnation, relate to modern science  • Explores the scientific discoveries of the rishis, ancient Vedic sages, and how they have only recently been rediscovered by Western scientists  • Reveals the concepts of quantum physics hidden within the Vedas, the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads, and the Puranas  Called “the scientists of Hinduism,” the rishis of ancient India were the scribes of the Vedas. They developed the spiritual science of Hinduism, Sanatana Dharma, as their way of ensuring the constant renewal and progress of India’s spiritual tradition and culture. Sanatana Dharma permeates every aspect of Hindu culture, from religion to the arts to the sciences. Woven within its Vedic texts lie all of the essential concepts of quantum physics and other modern scientific discoveries.  Providing a complete introduction to the science of Sanatana Dharma, Vanamali reveals how the core concepts of Hinduism, including Brahman, Atman, bhakti, karma, and reincarnation, relate to modern science and how the scientific discoveries of the ancient rishis have been recently rediscovered by the West. She examines the scientific principles within the classic stories and texts of India, including the Vedas, the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads, and the Puranas. Within the teachings of the ancient Puranic sages and saints such as Valmiki and Vyasa and legendary physicians and mathematician-philosophers such as Aryabhatta and Varahamihir, the author reveals great scientific truths--not those believed by the ancient world, but truths still upheld by modern science, particularly quantum physics. She explores Desha and Kaala (Space and Time), Shankara and his philosophy of Advaita Vedanta, and the Hindu sciences of mathematics, astronomy, and Vedic astrology.  In illustrating the scientific basis of Hinduism and the discoveries of its sages, Vanamali provides a window into the depths of this most ancient spiritual way of life.

A First Course in Partial Differential Equations: with Complex Variables and Transform Methods (Dover Books on Mathematics),H. F. Weinberger,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/40/e0/68/40e068eef8506704a4c9bbaf01344b42.gif,"
                    I got this book after finishing Farlow's Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and Engineers. This is a much more mathematically rigorous and sophisticated book, and it took me a lot longer to go through it. (I still haven't done the last two sections on the Laplace transform and approximation methods). My original goal was to learn complex analysis, and since Farlow recommended this book for that topic, I started in the middle with Section VIII, Analytic Functions of a Complex Variable, then did IX and X, then I through VII. This caused a few difficulties solving some of the problems in the later sections due to unfamiliarity with material presented in the earlier sections. E.g. problem 71.4 presumes a knowledge of Green's function, which is covered in section V. Nonetheless, this worked out OK. I now feel as though I have a pretty solid grounding in the material (by which I mean not that I can remember it all, but I can recognize when I've seen it before, and know where to look it up again). That is my operational definition of having ""learned"" the material.  Frankly, I'm quite surprised by the second reviewer's comment that this book would not be good for self-instruction. I thought it was great! But I had to be very patient and resist the urge to move ahead before I really understood what I had just read. Doing the problems is an excellent reality check! That's one of the features of this book that I liked the most: lots of problems, with ALL the answers in the back, so you can't fool yourself. Most of the answers can be reached with persistence, although I was stumped by a few. But don't buy this book if you don't have a background in calculus and ordinary differential equations! It would also be helpful to review the topic of partial differential equations in an easier format, like Farlow, before progressing to this text.  The material is interesting and varied. There are sections heavy on abstract math and proofs of theorems, other sections mostly practical in orientation. The section on complex analysis lives up to its billing in Farlow. In general, I found that I could skim through the really abstract material without losing the thread of the argument. I'm not good at proofs so I skipped over most of the problems that called for proving something. But at least now I know what is meant by existence and uniqueness proofs, etc.  The book has very few errors. I've listed the ones I think are errors below. Maybe they are and maybe they aren't! p. 182 second paragraph R(r) sin(n*theta) etc. should be R(r) sin(m*theta) etc.  p. 192 fifth line from bottom ""degree n in x,y, and z"" should be ""degree n in x,y, and r"". p. 223 second equation from bottom should be du2/de*du1/dx - dv2/de*dv1/dx + i(dv2/de*du1/dx + du2/de*dv1/dx) p. 265 last equation right hand side integrand should be e^(-i*theta), not e^(i*theta).  Solutions to exercises: 1.4: rho subzero du1/dx + d rho subone/dt = 0 5.4: answer can be reduced further to 157/4096, which is how my calculator displayed it 7.5: last line: dA/dt greater than or equal to 0 10.2: second line: epsilon 3 = z*sqrt(alpha/D) 14.1e: e^(-n^2*pi^2*t-t-x)*sin(n*pi*(x-1)) 18.4: right side of equation should be 1/2 (e^pi + e^(-pi)) i.e. cosh(pi) 31.4: one times first sum, not two times first sum, and difference between first sum and second (double) sum, not sum of the two 32.3: second line, numerator, sinh term should be sinh (sqrt((n-1/2)^2 + (2m-1)^2 +1) * (1-z)) 37.1: substituting xbar = x+1 in formula for c sub-n I get c sub-n twice what answer gives.  37.4: formula for c sub-n: integrand should include (1+x)^-1, not ^-2. 44.4: the exponential t-term is e^(-(mu sub-k supra-(n+1/2))*t), not e^(-mu sub-k supra-((n+1/2)*t)) 50.7: log term is log(2 plus or minus sqrt(3)) 53.4: the part of the disk to the LEFT of the line.... 58.2: ? pi*i*(e-2) 58.7: ? -pi/3 Happy self-instructing!

This volume focuses on recent developments in non-linear and hyperbolic equations. In the first contribution, the singularities of the solutions of several classes of non-linear partial differential equations are investigated. Applications concern the Monge-Ampère equation, quasi-linear systems arising in fluid mechanics as well as integro-differential equations for media with memory. There follows an article on L_p-L_q decay estimates for Klein-Gordon equations with time-dependent coefficients, explaining, in particular, the influence of the relation between the mass term and the wave propagation speed. The next paper addresses questions of local existence of solutions, blow-up criteria, and C^8 regularity for quasilinear weakly hyperbolic equations. Spectral theory of semibounded selfadjoint operators is the topic of a further contribution, providing upper and lower bounds for the bottom eigenvalue as well as an upper bound for the second eigenvalue in terms of capacitary estimates.

In Thermal Physics: Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics for Scientists and Engineers, the fundamental laws of thermodynamics are stated precisely as postulates and subsequently connected to historical context and developed mathematically. These laws are applied systematically to topics such as phase equilibria, chemical reactions, external forces, fluid-fluid surfaces and interfaces, and anisotropic crystal-fluid interfaces. Statistical mechanics is presented in the context of information theory to quantify entropy, followed by development of the most important ensembles: microcanonical, canonical, and grand canonical. A unified treatment of ideal classical, Fermi, and Bose gases is presented, including Bose condensation, degenerate Fermi gases, and classical gases with internal structure. Additional topics include paramagnetism, adsorption on dilute sites, point defects in crystals, thermal aspects of intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors, density matrix formalism, the Ising model, and an introduction to Monte Carlo simulation.  Throughout the book, problems are posed and solved to illustrate specific results and problem-solving techniques.Includes applications of interest to physicists, physical chemists, and materials scientists, as well as materials, chemical, and mechanical engineersSuitable as a textbook for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and practicing researchersDevelops content systematically with increasing order of complexitySelf-contained, including nine appendices to handle necessary background and technical details   ",https://1lib.in/dl/2717455/526ff6,610,Elsevier,2015,english,"PDF, 7.57 MB"

A timely introduction to current research on PID and predictive control by one of the leading authors on the subject PID and Predictive Control of Electric Drives and Power Supplies using MATLAB/Simulink examines the classical control system strategies, such as PID control, feed-forward control and cascade control, which are widely used in current practice.  The authors share their experiences in actual design and implementation of the control systems on laboratory test-beds, taking the reader from the fundamentals through to more sophisticated design and analysis.    The book contains sections on closed-loop performance analysis in both frequency domain and time domain, presented to help the designer in selection of controller parameters and validation of the control system.  Continuous-time model predictive control systems are designed for the drives and power supplies, and operational constraints are imposed in the design.    Discrete-time model predictive control systems are designed based on the discretization of the physical models, which will appeal to readers who are more familiar with sampled-data control system. Soft sensors and observers will be discussed for low cost implementation.  Resonant control of the electric drives and power supply will be discussed to deal with the problems of bias in sensors and unbalanced three phase AC currents.  Brings together both classical control systems and predictive control systems in a logical style from introductory through to advanced levels Demonstrates how simulation and experimental results are used to support theoretical analysis and the proposed design algorithms MATLAB and Simulink tutorials are given in each chapter to show the readers how to take the theory to applications.  Includes MATLAB and Simulink software using xPC Target for teaching purposes A companion website is available  Researchers and industrial engineers; and graduate students on electrical engineering courses will find this a valuable resource.

Dynamics is a science concerned with movement and changes. In the most general approach it relates to life processes as well as behavior in nature in rest. It governs small particles, technical objects, conversion of matter and materials but also concerns people, groups of people in their individual and, in particular, social dimension. In dynamics we always have to do with causes or stimuli for motion, the rules of reaction or behavior and its result in the form of trajectory of changes.This book is devoted to dynamics of a wide class of specific but very important objects such as electromechanical systems. This is a very rigorous discipline and has a long tradition, as its theoretical bases were formulated in the first half of the XIX century by d’ Alembert, Lagrange, Hamilton, Maxwell and other prominent scientists, but their crucial results were based on previous pioneering research of others such as Copernicus, Galileo, Newton…This book in its theoretical foundations is based on the principle of least action which governs classical as well as relativistic mechanics and electromagnetism and leads to Lagrange’s equations which are applied in the book as universal method to construct equations of motion of electromechanical systems. It gives common and coherent grounds to formulate mathematical models for all lumped parameters’ electromechanical systems, which are vital in our contemporary industry and civilized everyday life.From these remarks it seems that the book is general and theoretical but in fact it is a very practical one concerning modern electrical drives in a broad sense, including electromechanical energy conversion, induction motor drives, brushless DC drives with a permanent magnet excitation and switched reluctance machines (SRM). And of course their control, which means shaping of their trajectories of motion using modern tools, their designed autonomy in keeping a track according to our programmed expectations.The problems presented in the book are widely illustrated by characteristics, trajectories, dynamic courses all computed by use of developed simulation models throughout the book. There are some classical subjects and the history of the discipline is discussed but finally all modern tools and means are presented and applied.More detailed descriptions follow in abstracts for the particular chapters.The author hopes kind readers will enjoy and profit from reading this book.

The concept of moving machine members during a thermodynamic cycle and the variation ofdisplacements, velocities and accelerations forms the subject of kinematics.The study of forces that make the motion is the subject of kinetics; combining these two subjects leads to dynamics of machinery. When we include the machinery aspects such as links, kinematic chains, and mechanisms to form a given machine we have the subject of Theory of Machines. Usually this subject is introduced as a two-semester course, where kinematics and kinetics are taught simultaneously withthermodynamics or heat engines before progressing to the design of machine members. This book provides the material for first semester of a Theory of Machines- course.Th is book brings in the machine live onto the screen and explains the theory of machines concepts through animations and introduces how the problems are solved in industry to present a complete history in the shortest possible time rather than using graphical (or analytical) methods. Thus the students are introduced to the concepts through visual means which brings industrial applications by the end of the two semester program closer, and equips them better for design courses. The International Federation for promotion of Mechanism and Machine Science (IFToMM) has developed standardnomenclature and notation on Mechanism and Machine Science and this book adopts these standards so that any communication between scientists and in the classrooms across the world can make use of the same terminology. This book adopts HyperWorks MotionSolve to perform the analysis and visualizations, though the book can be used independent of the requirement of any particular software. However, having this software helps in further studies and analysis.

                    For many years, various editions of Smallman's Modern Physical Metallurgy have served throughout the world as a standard undergraduate textbook on metals and alloys. In 1995, it was rewritten and enlarged to encompass the related subject of materials science and engineering and appeared under the title Metals & Materials: Science, Processes, Applications offering a comprehensive amount of a much wider range of engineering materials. Coverage ranged from pure elements to superalloys, from glasses to engineering ceramics, and from everyday plastics to in situ composites, Amongst other favourable reviews, Professor Bhadeshia of Cambridge University commented: ""Given the amount of work that has obviously gone into this book and its extensive comments, it is very attractively priced. It is an excellent book to be recommend strongly for purchase by undergraduates in materials-related subjects, who should benefit greatly by owning a text containing so much knowledge.The book now includes new chapters on materials for sports equipment (golf, tennis, bicycles, skiing, etc.) and biomaterials (replacement joints, heart valves, tissue repair, etc.) - two of the most exciting and rewarding areas in current materials research and development. As in its predecessor, numerous examples are given of the ways in which knowledge of the relation between fine structure and properties has made it possible to optimise the service behaviour of traditional engineering materials and to develop completely new and exciting classes of materials. Special consideration is given to the crucial processing stage that enables materials to be produced as marketable commodities. Whilst attempting to produce a useful and relatively concise survey of key materials and their interrelationships, the authors have tried to make the subject accessible to a wide range of readers, to provide insights into specialised methods of examination and to convey the excitement of the atmosphere in which new materials are conceived and developed.

Starting with descriptions of how each area of the plant operates, it shows how the relevant control systems have evolved, how they are implemented in modern systems and how to evaluate the merits of alternative approaches. The rise of renewable power in the generation mix, and of biomass in the fuel, has demanded greater flexibility from combustion plants, requiring more sophisticated and robust control. In parallel, thermal power plants have been developed with overfire air systems to reduce NOx, once-through supercritical boilers to increase efficiency and model-based control schemes to optimise response. These developments have brought opportunities in terms of flexibility, energy efficiency and safety, but also the risk of a comprehension gap between control specialists and power plant engineers, a gap this new edition aims to bridge.

                    Materials are the foundation of technology. As such, most universities provide engineering undergraduates with the fundamental concepts of materials science, including crystal structures, imperfections, phase diagrams, materials processing, and materials properties. Few, however, offer the practical, applications-oriented background that their students need to succeed in industry.Applied Materials Science: Applications of Engineering Materials in Structural, Electronics, Thermal, and Other Industries fills that gap. From a cross-disciplinary perspective that reflects both the multifunctionality of many materials and the wide scope industrial needs, the author examines the practical applications of metal, ceramic, polymer, cement, carbon, and composite materials across a broad range of industries. The topics addressed include electronic packaging, smart materials, thermal management, nondestructive evaluation, and materials development. The text is clear, coherent, and tutorial in style, includes numerous up-to-date references, and provides background material in a series of appendices.Unique in its breadth of coverage of both materials and their applications, Applied Materials Science is both scientifically rich and technologically relevant. If you work or teach those that aspire to work in an engineering capacity, you will find no text or reference that better prepares its readers for real-world applications of engineering materials.

                    Metrology is the science of measurements. It is traceable to measurement standards, thus to the concept of measurement accuracy, which is used in all natural and technical sciences, as well as in some fields of social sciences and liberal arts. The key problem is one of obtaining knowledge of the physical reality, which is observed through a prism of an assemblage of quantity properties describing the objectively-real world. One of the fundamental tasks of metrology is the development of theoretical and methodological aspects of the procedure of getting an accurate knowledge relating to objects and processes of the surrounding world. Due to the rapid development of information technologies and intelligent measurement systems and measuring instruments, as well as to the growing usage of mathematical methods in social and biological sciences, this monograph is dedicated to convey the fundamental theory.

                    The International System of Units (SI) is the world's most widely used system of measurement, used every day in commerce and science, and is the modern form of the metric system. It currently comprises the meter (m), the kilogram (kg), the second (s), the ampere (A), the kelvin (K), the candela (cd) and the mole (mol)). The system is changing though, units and unit definitions are modified through international agreements as the technology of measurement progresses, and as the precision of measurements improves. The SI is now being redefined based on constants of nature and their realization by quantum standards. Therefore, the underlying physics and technologies will receive increasing interest, and not only in the metrology community but in all fields of science. This book introduces and explains the applications of modern physics concepts to metrology, the science and the applications of measurements. A special focus is made on the use of quantum standards for the realization of the forthcoming new SI (the international system of units). The basic physical phenomena are introduced on a level which provides comprehensive information for the experienced reader but also provides a guide for a more intense study of these phenomena for students.

                    This book equips the reader to understand every important aspect of the dynamics of rotating machines. Will the vibration be large? What influences machine stability? How can the vibration be reduced? Which sorts of rotor vibration are the worst? The book develops this understanding initially using extremely simple models for each phenomenon, in which (at most) four equations capture the behavior. More detailed models are then developed based on finite element analysis, to enable the accurate simulation of the relevant phenomena for real machines. Analysis software (in MATLAB) is associated with this book, and novices to rotordynamics can expect to make good predictions of critical speeds and rotating mode shapes within days. The book is structured more as a learning guide than as a reference tome and provides readers with more than 100 worked examples and more than 100 problems and solutions.

This book is a result of the author's work which was initiated about a decade ago and which, in the meantime, has resulted in his Ph.D. Thesis and several technical papers. The book deals with accurate modeling of electric machines during transient and steady states, a topic which has been usually avoided in the literature. The modeling techniques herein take into account all machine peculiarities, such as the type and connection of its windings, slotting, and saturation in the iron core. A special emphasis in the book is given to the exact physical interpretation of all phenomena which influence the machine's transient behavior. Besides the Introduction, the book has five chapters. The second chapter describes basic concepts of the magnetic equivalent circuit theory and has examples of magnetic equivalent circuits of several types of machines with their node potential equations. In the third chapter the transform matrices w' and w"" of A.C. wind­ ings are derived. These matrices playa very important role in the magnetic equivalent circuit theory because they connect the quantities from the ma­ chine's magnetic equivalent circuit, branch fluxes, and mmfs with the ma­ chine's phase currents and fluxes.

With the increasing complexity and dynamism in today’s machine design and development, more precise, robust and practical approaches and systems are needed to support machine design. Existing design methods treat the targeted machine as stationery. Analysis and simulation are mostly performed at the component level. Although there are some computer-aided engineering tools capable of motion analysis and vibration simulation etc., the machine itself is in the dry-run state. For effective machine design, understanding its thermal behaviours is crucial in achieving the desired performance in real situation.Dynamic Thermal Analysis of Machines in Running State presents a set of innovative solutions to dynamic thermal analysis of machines when they are put under actual working conditions. The objective is to better understand the thermal behaviours of a machine in real situation while at the design stage. The book has two major sections, with the first section presenting a broad-based review of the key areas of research in dynamic thermal analysis and simulation, and the second section presents an in-depth treatment of relevant methodology and algorithms, leading to better understanding of a machine in real situation.The book is a collection of novel ideas, taking into account the need for presenting intellectual challenges while appealing to a broad readership, including academic researchers, practicing engineers and managers, and graduate students. Given the essential role of modern machines in factory automation and quality assurance, a book dedicated to the topic of dynamic thermal analysis, and its practical applications to machine design would be beneficial to readers of all design and manufacturing sectors, from machine design to automotive engineering, in better understanding the present challenges and solutions, as well as future research directions in this important area.

This book, intended for people in engineering and fundamental sciences, presents an integrated mathematical methodology for advanced dynamics and control of structures and machines, ranging from the derivation of models up to the control synthesis problem. This point of view is particularly useful as the physical insight and the associated structural properties, related e.g. to the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian framework, can be advantageously utilized. To this end, up to date results in disciplines like continuum mechanics, analytical mechanics, thermodynamics and electrodynamics are presented exploiting the differential geometric properties, with the basic notions of this coordinate-free approach revisited in an own chapter. In order to illustrate the proposed methodologies, several industrial applications, e.g., the derivation of exact solutions for the deformation compensation by shaped actuation in elastic bodies, or the coordination of rigid and flexible joint robots, are discussed.

                    This broad-based book covers the three major areas of Chemical Engineering. Most of the books in the market involve one of the individual areas, namely, Fluid Mechanics, Heat Transfer or Mass Transfer, rather than all the three. This book presents this material in a single source. This avoids the user having to refer to a number of books to obtain information. Most published books covering all the three areas in a single source emphasize theory rather than practical issues. This book is written with emphasis on practice with brief theoretical concepts in the form of questions and answers, not adopting stereo-typed question-answer approach practiced in certain books in the market, bridging the two areas of theory and practice with respect to the core areas of chemical engineering. Most parts of the book are easily understandable by those who are not experts in the field. Fluid Mechanics chapters include basics on non-Newtonian systems which, for instance find importance in polymer and food processing, flow through piping, flow measurement, pumps, mixing technology and fluidization and two phase flow. For example it covers types of pumps and valves, membranes and areas of their use, different equipment commonly used in chemical industry and their merits and drawbacks. Heat Transfer chapters cover the basics involved in conduction, convection and radiation, with emphasis on insulation, heat exchangers, evaporators, condensers, reboilers and fired heaters. Design methods, performance, operational issues and maintenance problems are highlighted. Topics such as heat pipes, heat pumps, heat tracing, steam traps, refrigeration, cooling of electronic devices, NOx control find place in the book. Mass transfer chapters cover basics such as diffusion, theories, analogies, mass transfer coefficients and mass transfer with chemical reaction, equipment such as tray and packed columns, column internals including structural packings, design, operational and installation issues, drums and separators are discussed in good detail. Absorption, distillation, extraction and leaching with applications and design methods, including emerging practices involving Divided Wall and Petluk column arrangements, multicomponent separations, supercritical solvent extraction find place in the book.

Fundamentals of Finite Element Analysis: Linear Finite Element Analysis,Ioannis Koutromanos,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/27/ba/e0/27bae0688808f9f0705d08df27463e7d.jpg,"
An introductory textbook covering the fundamentals of linear finite element analysis (FEA)  This book constitutes the first volume in a two-volume set that introduces readers to the theoretical foundations and the implementation of the finite element method (FEM). The first volume focuses on the use of the method for linear problems. A general procedure is presented for the finite element analysis (FEA) of a physical problem, where the goal is to specify the values of a field function. First, the strong form of the problem (governing differential equations and boundary conditions) is formulated. Subsequently, a weak form of the governing equations is established. Finally, a finite element approximation is introduced, transforming the weak form into a system of equations where the only unknowns are nodal values of the field function. The procedure is applied to one-dimensional elasticity and heat conduction, multi-dimensional steady-state scalar field problems (heat conduction, chemical diffusion, flow in porous media), multi-dimensional elasticity and structural mechanics (beams/shells), as well as time-dependent (dynamic) scalar field problems, elastodynamics and structural dynamics. Important concepts for finite element computations, such as isoparametric elements for multi-dimensional analysis and Gaussian quadrature for numerical evaluation of integrals, are presented and explained. Practical aspects of FEA and advanced topics, such as reduced integration procedures, mixed finite elements and verification and validation of the FEM are also discussed.   Provides detailed derivations of finite element equations for a variety of problems. Incorporates quantitative examples on one-dimensional and multi-dimensional FEA. Provides an overview of multi-dimensional linear elasticity (definition of stress and strain tensors, coordinate transformation rules, stress-strain relation and material symmetry) before presenting the pertinent FEA procedures. Discusses practical and advanced aspects of FEA, such as treatment of constraints, locking, reduced integration, hourglass control, and multi-field (mixed) formulations. Includes chapters on transient (step-by-step) solution schemes for time-dependent scalar field problems and elastodynamics/structural dynamics. Contains a chapter dedicated to verification and validation for the FEM and another chapter dedicated to solution of linear systems of equations and to introductory notions of parallel computing. Includes appendices with a review of matrix algebra and overview of matrix analysis of discrete systems.   Accompanied by a website hosting an open-source finite element program for linear elasticity and heat conduction, together with a user tutorial.  Fundamentals of Finite Element Analysis: Linear Finite Element Analysis is an ideal text for undergraduate and graduate students in civil, aerospace and mechanical engineering, finite element software vendors, as well as practicing engineers and anybody with an interest in linear finite element analysis.

The analysis of composites treated in this textbook includes the analysis of the material itself, at the micro-level, and the analysis of structures made of composite materials. This textbook evolved from the class notes of MAE 646 Advanced Mechanics of Composite Materials that I teach as a graduate course at West Virginia University. Although this is also a textbook on advanced mechanics of composite materials, the use of the finite element method is essential for the solution of the complex boundary value problems encountered in the advanced analysis of composites, and thus the title of the book. There are a number of good textbooks on advanced mechanics of composite materials, but none carries the theory to a practical level by actually solving problems, as it is done in this textbook. Some books devoted exclusively to finite element analysis include some examples about modeling composites but fall quite short of dealing with the actual analysis and design issues of composite materials and composite structures. This textbook includes an explanation of the concepts involved in the detailed analysis of composites, a sound explanation of the mechanics needed to translate those concepts into a mathematical representation of the physical reality, and a detailed explanation of the solution of the resulting boundary value problems by using commercial Finite Element Analysis software such as AbaqusTM.

This book gives Abaqus users who make use of finite-element models in academic or practitioner-based research the in-depth program knowledge that allows them to debug a structural analysis model. The book provides many methods and guidelines for different analysis types and modes, that will help readers to solve problems that can arise with Abaqus if a structural model fails to converge to a solution. The use of Abaqus affords a general checklist approach to debugging analysis models, which can also be applied to structural analysis.The author uses step-by-step methods and detailed explanations of special features in order to identify the solutions to a variety of problems with finite-element models. The book promotes: • a diagnostic mode of thinking concerning error messages; • better material definition and the writing of user material subroutines; • work with the Abaqus mesher and best practice in doing so; • the writing of user element subroutines and contact features with convergence issues; and• consideration of hardware and software issues and a Windows HPC cluster solution.The methods and information provided facilitate job diagnostics and help to obtain converged solutions for finite-element models regarding structural component assemblies in static or dynamic analysis. The troubleshooting advice ensures that these solutions are both high-quality and cost-effective according to practical experience. The book offers an in-depth guide for students learning about Abaqus, as each problem and solution are complemented by examples and straightforward explanations. It is also useful for academics and structural engineers wishing to debug Abaqus models on the basis of error and warning messages that arise during finite-element modelling processing.

                    Thermal Power Plant Control and Instrumentation describes the systems and equipment used for measuring and controlling boilers and heat-recovery steam-generators used in land and marine power plant and in process industries. It provides a practical guide to the design, installation, operation and maintenance of these systems. Starting with descriptions of how each area of the plant operates, it shows how the relevant control systems have evolved, how they are implemented in modern systems and how to evaluate the merits of alternative approaches. The rise of renewable power in the generation mix, and of biomass in the fuel, has demanded greater flexibility from combustion plants, requiring more sophisticated and robust control. In parallel, thermal power plants have been developed with overfire air systems to reduce NOx, once-through supercritical boilers to increase efficiency and model-based control schemes to optimise response. These developments have brought opportunities in terms of flexibility, energy efficiency and safety, but also the risk of a comprehension gap between control specialists and power plant engineers, a gap this new edition aims to bridge.

Design of Embedded Robust Control Systems Using MATLAB®/Simulink®,Petko Hristov Petkov,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/5f/4a/d0/5f4ad0a074ee211b356373e765a2c8ba.jpg,"
                    This book explores the implementation of MATLAB(R) and Simulink(R) in the development of embedded robust control systems. Robust control theory allows for changes in a system whilst maintaining stability and performance. Applications of this technique are very important for dependable embedded systems, making technologies such as drones and other autonomous systems with sophisticated embedded controllers and systems relatively common-place.Three extended case studies are developed in depth: embedded control of a tank physical model; robust control of a miniature helicopter; and robust control of two-wheeled robots. These are taken from the area of motion control but the book may be also used by designers in other areas.Some knowledge of linear control theory is assumed and experience of C programming is desirable but to make the book accessible to engineers new to the field and to students, the authors avoid complicated mathematical proofs and overwhelming computer architecture technical details. All programs used in the examples and case studies will be freely downloadable to help with the assimilation of the book contents.This book is essential reading for engineers, developers, designers, industrial practitioners, scientists, and researchers in Control, Automation, Robotics, Mechatronics, Mechanical Engineering, Computing, and Electronics (with a focus on robust control systems and the design, modelling and implementation of embedded systems).

                    Much has been written about the need to revitalize control education. This book addresses the problem by providing a refreshing new approach to teaching control system design. The book strongly emphasizes real-world design, making it appropriate for the first-time learner as well as for engineers in industry as a technology refresher. The book has been used by the authors for both undergraduate and graduate courses at several universities. The authors' experience is split evenly between academia and industry, which is reflected in the contents of the book. It is divided into 8 parts covering essential aspects in control, ranging from signals and systems (Bode diagrams, root locus, etc.), to SISO control (including PID and fundamental design tradeoffs), and MIMO systems (including constraints, MPC, decoupling, etc.).A key aspect of the book is the frequent use of real world design examples drawn directly from the authors' industrial experience. These are represented by over 15 substantial case studies ranging from distillation columns to satellite tracking. The book is also liberally supported by modern teaching aids available on both an accompanying CD-ROM and Companion Website. Resources to be found there include MATLABR routines for all examples; extensive PowerPoint lecture notes based on the book; and a totally unique Java Applet-driven ""virtual laboratory"" that allows readers to interact with the real-world case studies.

This file may be corrupted!A complete toolkit for teaching, learning, and understanding the essential concepts of automatic control systemsEdition after acclaimed edition, Automatic Control Systems has delivered up-to-date, real-world coverage designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of control systems. More than a comprehensive text, Automatic Control Systems includes innovative virtual labs that replicate physical systems and sharpen readers’ problem-solving skills.The Tenth Edition introduces the concept of Control Lab, which includes two classes of experiments: SIMLab (model-based simulation) and LEGOLab (physical experiments using LEGO® robots). These experiments are intended to supplement, or replace, the experimental exposure of the students in a traditional undergraduate control course and will allow these students to do their work within the MATLAB® and Simulink® environment—even at home. This cost-effective approach may allow educational institutions to equip their labs with a number of LEGO test beds and maximize student access to the equipment at a fraction of the cost of currently available control system experiments. Alternatively, as a supplemental learning tool, students can take the equipment home and learn at their own pace.This new edition continues a tradition of excellence with:• A greater number of solved examples  • Online labs using both LEGO MINDSTORMS® and MATLAB/SIMLab  • Enhancements to the easy-to-use MATLAB GUI software (ACSYS) to allow interface with LEGO MINDSTORMS  • A valuable introduction to the concept of Control Lab  • A logical organization, with Chapters 1 to 3 covering all background material and Chapters 4 to 11 presenting material directly related to the subject of control  • 10 online appendices, including Elementary Matrix Theory and Algebra, Control Lab, Difference Equations, and Mathematical Foundation  • A full-set of PowerPoint® slides and solutions available to instructorsAdopted by hundreds of universities and translated into at least nine languages, Automatic Control Systems remains the single-best resource for students to gain a practical understanding of the subject and to prepare them for the challenges they will one day face. For practicing engineers, it represents a clear, thorough, and current self-study resource that they will turn to again and again throughout their career.LEGO and MINDSTORMS are registered trademarks of the LEGO GroupMATLAB and Simulink are registered trademarks of The MathWorks, Inc.

                    At publication, The Control Handbook immediately became the definitive resource that engineers working with modern control systems required. Among its many accolades, that first edition was cited by the AAP as the Best Engineering Handbook of 1996.     Now, 15 years later, William Levine has once again compiled the most comprehensive and authoritative resource on control engineering. He has fully reorganized the text to reflect the technical advances achieved since the last edition and has expanded its contents to include the multidisciplinary perspective that is making control engineering a critical component in so many fields.    Now expanded from one to three volumes, The Control Handbook, Second Edition organizes cutting-edge contributions from more than 200 leading experts. The second volume, Control System Applications, includes 35 entirely new applications organized by subject area. Covering the design and use of control systems, this volume includes applications for:        Automobiles, including PEM fuel cells  Aerospace  Industrial control of machines and processes  Biomedical uses, including robotic surgery and drug discovery and development  Electronics and communication networks      Other applications are included in a section that reflects the multidisciplinary nature of control system work. These include applications for the construction of financial portfolios, earthquake response control for civil structures, quantum estimation and control, and the modeling and control of air conditioning and refrigeration systems.

                    This book is pretty good, provided you have an adequate grasp of the background information.  What I mean by that is: if you have had exposure to a course in system dynamics (not just classical dynamics), you should find that this book serves the purpose of teaching you control theory.  If on the other hand, you have not had exposure to system dynamics, you are in for a world of hurt, as the author does not guide the reader by the hand in developing the material in this book (note: this is particularly true in the early going when the material is presented as if it were a review, not a first go around).  In essence, you are left with a few choices: suffer through the text and repeatedly beat your head against the wall, get a solid system dynamics text to supplement the information in this book, or junk this text and find a control book that guides you through the subject matter a bit better - particularly if this is your first crack at control theory.  Option one isn't on the table if you really want a shot at passing your class, so for the other two options, consider the following: for a solid system dynamics text check out either Ogata, or Kelly (Ogata has alot of examples and MATLAB examples following the development of the subject matter, while Kelly has more meat in his development of the material and less examples however he does touch on developing Simulink models and some of his MATLAB codes are bit more sophisticated).  As far as an auxiliary control text, I would definitely check out Nise. His gentle development will allow the reader to easily grasp the subjects as presented and could be used as a self-study text on the subject matter (and both Nise and this text have nice a MATLAB brush-up as well as adaptation to the text material in their appendices and sprinkled through the text).  Overall not a bad text, but like a lot of the other reviewers I felt that it could be a bit better, so I'm knocking off a few stars.

There are good reasons why the subject of electric power engineering, after many years of neglect, is making a comeback in the undergraduate curriculum of many electrical engineering departments. The most obvious is the current public awareness of the ""energy crisis. "" More fundamental is the concern with social responsibility among college students in general and engineering students in particular. After all, electric power remains one of the cornerstones of our civilization, and the well-publicized problems of ecology, economy, safety, dependability and natural resources management pose ever-growing challenges to the best minds in the engineering community. Before an engineer can successfully involve himself in such problems, he must first be familiar with the main components of electric power systems. This text­ book will assist him in acquiring the necessary familiarity. The course for which this book is mainly intended can be taken by any student who has had some cir­ cuit analysis (using discrete elements, and including sinusoidal steady state) and elementary electromagnetic field theory. Most students taking the course will be in their junior or senior years. Once the course is completed, students may decide to go more deeply into the design and operation of these components and study them on a more advanced level, or they may direct their attention to the problems of the system itself, problems which are only hinted at briefly at various points herein.

Entrepreneurship in Power Semiconductor Devices, Power Electronics, and Electric Machines and Drive Systems introduces the basics of entrepreneurship and a methodology for the study of entrepreneurship in electrical engineering and other engineering fields. Entrepreneurship is considered here in three fields of electrical engineering, viz. power semiconductor devices, power electronics and electric machines and drive systems, and their current practice. It prepares the reader by providing a review of the subject matter in the three fields, their current status in research and development with analysis aspect as needed, thus allowing readers to gain self-sufficiency while reading the book. Each field’s emerging applications, current market and future market forecasts are introduced to understand the basis and need for emerging startups. Practical learning is introduced in: (i) power semiconductor devices entrepreneurship through the prism of 20 startups in detail, (ii) power electronics entrepreneurship through 28 startup companies arranged under various application fields and (iii) electric machines and drive systems entrepreneurship through 15 startups in electromagnetic and 1 in electrostatic machines and drive systems.  The book: (i) demystifies entrepreneurship in a practical way to equip engineers and students with entrepreneurship as an option for their professional growth, pursuit and success; (ii) provides engineering managers and corporate-level executives a detailed view of entrepreneurship activities in the considered three fields that may potentially impact their businesses, (iii) provides entrepreneurship education in an electrical engineering environment and with direct connection and correlation to their fields of study and (iv) endows a methodology that can be effectively employed not only in the three illustrated fields of electrical engineering but in other fields as well.  This book is for electrical engineering students and professionals. For use in undergraduate and graduate courses in electrical engineering, the book contains discussion questions, exercise problems, team and class projects, all from a practical point of view, to train students and assist professionals for future entrepreneurship endeavors.

Data and Electric Power: From Deterministic Machines to Probabilistic Systems in Traditional Engineering,Sean Patrick Murphy,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/a8/a9/f2/a8a9f2a68836095bad274529bca75152.jpg,"
                    Traditional engineering is built upon a world of knowledge and scientific laws, with components and systems that operate predictably. But what happens when a large number of these devices are interconnected? You get a complex system that’s no longer deterministic, but probabilistic. That’s happening today in many industries, including manufacturing, petroleum, transportation, and energy.

In this O’Reilly report, Sean Patrick Murphy, Chief Data Scientist at PingThings, describes how data science is helping electric utilities make sense of a stochastic world filled with increasing uncertainty—including fundamental changes to the energy market and random phenomena such as weather and solar activity.

Murphy also reviews several cutting-edge tools for storing and processing big data that he’s used in his work with electric utilities—tools that can help traditional engineers pursue a data-driven approach in many industries.

Topics in this report include:

    - Key drivers that have changed the electric grid from a deterministic machine into probabilistic system.
    - Fundamental differences that put traditional engineering and data science at odds with one another.
    - Why the time is right for engineering organizations to adopt a complete data-driven approach.
    - Contemporary tools that traditional engineers can use to store and process big data.
    - A PingThings case study for dealing with random geomagnetic disturbances to the energy grid.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/5213941/0f24d5,40,O’Reilly,2016,english,"PDF, 4.34 MB"

                    Power Quality of power systems affects all connected electrical and electronic equipment. Power Quality is a measure of deviations in voltage and frequency of the particular supply system. In recent years, there has been a considerable increase in nonlinear loads; in particular distributed loads, such as computers, TV monitors and lighting. These draw harmonic currents which, when distorted, have detrimental effects including interference, loss of reliability, increased operating costs, equipment overheating, motor failures, capacitor failure and inaccurate power metering. This subject is pertinent to engineers involved with electric power systems, electronic equipment, computers and manufacturing equipment. This book shows readers to understand the causes and effects of power quality problems such as non-sinusoidal wave shapes, voltage outages, losses due to poor power quality, origins of single-time events such as voltage dips, voltage reductions, and outages, along with techniques to mitigate these problems.                                       .

                    This book equips the reader to understand every important aspect of the dynamics of rotating machines. Will the vibration be large? What influences machine stability? How can the vibration be reduced? Which sorts of rotor vibration are the worst? The book develops this understanding initially using extremely simple models for each phenomenon, in which (at most) four equations capture the behavior. More detailed models are then developed based on finite element analysis, to enable the accurate simulation of the relevant phenomena for real machines. Analysis software (in MATLAB) is associated with this book, and novices to rotordynamics can expect to make good predictions of critical speeds and rotating mode shapes within days.

                    The study of the kinematics and dynamics of machines lies at the very core of a mechanical engineering background. Although tremendous advances have been made in the computational and design tools now available, little has changed in the way the subject is presented, both in the classroom and in professional references.Fundamentals of Kinematics and Dynamics of Machines and Mechanisms brings the subject alive and current. The author's careful integration of Mathematica software gives readers a chance to perform symbolic analysis, to plot the results, and most importantly, to animate the motion. They get to ""play"" with the mechanism parameters and immediately see their effects. A CD-ROM packaged with the book contains Mathematica-based programs for suggested design projects.As useful as Mathematica is, however, a tool should not interfere with but enhance one's grasp of the concepts and the development of analytical skills. The author ensures this with his emphasis on the understanding and application of basic theoretical principles, unified approach to the analysis of planar mechanisms, and introduction to vibrations and rotordynamics.

This book is a result of the author's work which was initiated about a decade ago and which, in the meantime, has resulted in his Ph.D. Thesis and several technical papers. The book deals with accurate modeling of electric machines during transient and steady states, a topic which has been usually avoided in the literature. The modeling techniques herein take into account all machine peculiarities, such as the type and connection of its windings, slotting, and saturation in the iron core. A special emphasis in the book is given to the exact physical interpretation of all phenomena which influence the machine's transient behavior. Besides the Introduction, the book has five chapters. The second chapter describes basic concepts of the magnetic equivalent circuit theory and has examples of magnetic equivalent circuits of several types of machines with their node potential equations. In the third chapter the transform matrices w' and w"" of A.C. wind­ ings are derived. These matrices playa very important role in the magnetic equivalent circuit theory because they connect the quantities from the ma­ chine's magnetic equivalent circuit, branch fluxes, and mmfs with the ma­ chine's phase currents and fluxes.

Basic models and concepts of machine dynamics and motion control are presented in the order of the principal steps of machine design. The machine is treated as a coupled dynamical system, including drive, mechanisms and controller, to reveal its behavior at different regimes through the interaction of its units under dynamic and processing loads. The main dynamic effects in machines are explained. The influence of component compliances on accuracy, stability and efficiency of the machines is analyzed. Methods for decreasing internal and external vibration activity of machines are described. The dynamic features of digital control are considered. Special attention is given to machines with intense dynamic behavior: resonant and hand-held percussion ones. Targeted to engineers as well as to lecturers and advanced students.

Dynamic Thermal Analysis of Machines in Running State,Lihui Wang (auth.),https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/6f/34/ed/6f34ed69509629bd7db0495172df447c.jpg,"
With the increasing complexity and dynamism in today’s machine design and development, more precise, robust and practical approaches and systems are needed to support machine design. Existing design methods treat the targeted machine as stationery. Analysis and simulation are mostly performed at the component level. Although there are some computer-aided engineering tools capable of motion analysis and vibration simulation etc., the machine itself is in the dry-run state. For effective machine design, understanding its thermal behaviours is crucial in achieving the desired performance in real situation.Dynamic Thermal Analysis of Machines in Running State presents a set of innovative solutions to dynamic thermal analysis of machines when they are put under actual working conditions. The objective is to better understand the thermal behaviours of a machine in real situation while at the design stage. The book has two major sections, with the first section presenting a broad-based review of the key areas of research in dynamic thermal analysis and simulation, and the second section presents an in-depth treatment of relevant methodology and algorithms, leading to better understanding of a machine in real situation.The book is a collection of novel ideas, taking into account the need for presenting intellectual challenges while appealing to a broad readership, including academic researchers, practicing engineers and managers, and graduate students. Given the essential role of modern machines in factory automation and quality assurance, a book dedicated to the topic of dynamic thermal analysis, and its practical applications to machine design would be beneficial to readers of all design and manufacturing sectors, from machine design to automotive engineering, in better understanding the present challenges and solutions, as well as future research directions in this important area.

This book, intended for people in engineering and fundamental sciences, presents an integrated mathematical methodology for advanced dynamics and control of structures and machines, ranging from the derivation of models up to the control synthesis problem. This point of view is particularly useful as the physical insight and the associated structural properties, related e.g. to the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian framework, can be advantageously utilized. To this end, up to date results in disciplines like continuum mechanics, analytical mechanics, thermodynamics and electrodynamics are presented exploiting the differential geometric properties, with the basic notions of this coordinate-free approach revisited in an own chapter. In order to illustrate the proposed methodologies, several industrial applications, e.g., the derivation of exact solutions for the deformation compensation by shaped actuation in elastic bodies, or the coordination of rigid and flexible joint robots, are discussed.

Fundamentals of Kinematics and Dynamics of Machines and Mechanisms,Oleg Vinogradov,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/cb/da/d2/cbdad2d423676eb29a8366a356f9537e.jpg,"
                    The study of the kinematics and dynamics of machines lies at the very core of a mechanical engineering background. Although tremendous advances have been made in the computational and design tools now available, little has changed in the way the subject is presented, both in the classroom and in professional references.

Fundamentals of Kinematics and Dynamics of Machines and Mechanisms brings the subject alive and current. The author's careful integration of Mathematica software gives readers a chance to perform symbolic analysis, to plot the results, and most importantly, to animate the motion. They get to ""play"" with the mechanism parameters and immediately see their effects. A CD-ROM packaged with the book contains Mathematica-based programs for suggested design projects.

As useful as Mathematica is, however, a tool should not interfere with but enhance one's grasp of the concepts and the development of analytical skills. The author ensures this with his emphasis on the understanding and application of basic theoretical principles, unified approach to the analysis of planar mechanisms, and introduction to vibrations and rotordynamics.

Getting Started with CNC is the definitive introduction to working with affordable desktop and benchtop CNCs, written by the creator of the popular open hardware CNC, the Shapeoko. Accessible 3D printing introduced the masses to computer-controlled additive fabrication. But the flip side of that is subtractive fabrication: instead of adding material to create a shape like a 3D printer does, a CNC starts with a solid piece of material and takes away from it. Although inexpensive 3D printers can make great things with plastic, a CNC can carve highly durable pieces out of a block of aluminum, wood, and other materials.

Computer Numerical Control (CNC) controllers, working as a brain for manufacturing automation, are high value-added products counting for over 30% of the price of machine tools. CNC technology is generally considered as a measure for the level of manufacturing technology of a nation. Often referred to as ""The Flower of Industrial Technology"", the development of CNC technology depends upon the integration of technologies from computer, hardware, machining, and other industries, and requires strategic long-term support, mostly on a governmental level.Theory and Design of CNC Systems covers the elements of control, the design of control systems, and modern open-architecture control systems. Topics covered include Numerical Control Kernel (NCK) design of CNC, Programmable Logic Control (PLC), and the Man-Machine Interface (MMI), as well as the major modules for the development of conversational programming methods. The concepts and primary elements of STEP-NC are also introduced.A collaboration of several authors with considerable experience in CNC development, education, and research, Theory and Design of CNC Systems is a highly focused textbook on the principles and development technologies of CNC controllers, which can also be used as a guide for those working on CNC development in industry.

                    The study of artificial intelligence and robotics offer the enormous potential of continuing the wide-reaching debate about how men and machines live together, now and in the future. The notion that a machine can respond to its environment, make decisions, and learn, has been the stuff of science fiction for hundreds of years. This work examines the key principles and concepts behind the engineering and technological advances that have allowed IBM’s Deep Blue to compete against professional chess players and game show contestants, and a device to by itself vacuum your house. Artificial intelligence (AI) infers that a machine can assess its surroundings and take steps toward a goal. Self-driving cars rely on AI not only to map a route and obey established traffic law, but also to respond to the behaviors of cars around them. Robots rely on computers, sensory feedback systems, and information processing in order to perform in the place of humans.

Machine vision inspection systems (MVIS) utilized all industrial and non-industrial applications where the execution of their utilities based on the acquisition and processing of images. MVIS can be applicable in industry, governmental, defense, aerospace, remote sensing, medical, and academic/education applications but constraints are different. MVIS entails acceptable accuracy, high reliability, high robustness, and low cost. Image processing is a well-defined transformation between human vision and image digitization, and their techniques are the foremost way to experiment in the MVIS. The digital image technique furnishes improved pictorial information by processing the image data through machine vision perception. Digital image pro­cessing has widely been used in MVIS applications and it can be employed to a wide diversity of problems particularly in Non-Destructive testing (NDT), presence/absence detection, defect/fault detection (weld, textile, tiles, wood, etc.,), automated vision test & measurement, pattern matching, optical character recognition & verification (OCR/OCV), barcode reading and traceability, medical diagnosis, weather forecasting, face recognition, defence and space research, etc. This edited book is designed to address various aspects of recent methodologies, concepts and research plan out to the readers for giving more depth insights for perusing research on machine vision using image processing techniques.

                    Vision plays a fundamental role for living beings by allowing them to interact with the environment in an effective and efficient way. The ultimate goal of Machine Vision is to endow artificial systems with adequate capabilities to cope with not a priori predetermined situations. To this end, we have to take into account the computing constraints of the hosting architectures and the specifications of the tasks to be accomplished, to continuously adapt and optimize the visual processing techniques. Nevertheless, by exploiting the low?cost computational power of off?the?shell computing devices, Machine Vision is not limited any more to industrial environments, where situations and tasks are simplified and very specific, but it is now pervasive to support system solutions of everyday life problems.

Robust control, H-Infinity and guaranteed cost control theory are also used for analysis and design of mechatronic systems. Different controller such as state feedback, static output feedback and dynamic output feedback controllers are used to stabilize mechatronic systems. Heuristic algorithms are provided to solve the design of the classical controller such as PID, phase lead, phase lag and phase lead-lag controllers while linear matrix inequalities (LMI) algorithms are provided for finding solutions to the state feedback, static output feedback and dynamic output feedback controllers.The theory presented in the different chapters of the volume is applied to numerical examples to show the usefulness of the theoretical results. Some case studies are also provided to show how the developed concepts apply for real system. Emphasis is also put on the implementation in real-time for some real systems that we have developed in our mechatronic laboratory and all the detail is provided to give an idea to the reader how to implement its own mechatronic system.Mechatronics Systems: Analysis, Design and Implementation is an excellent textbook for undergraduate and graduate students in mechatronic system and control theory and as a reference for academic researchers in control or mathematics with interest in control theory. The reader should have completed first-year graduate courses in control theory, linear algebra, and linear systems. It will also be of great value to engineers practising in fields where the systems can be modeled by linear time invariant systems.

Introduction to Modeling and Simulation with MATLAB® and Python,Steven I. Gordon,https://covers.zlibcdn2.com/covers100/books/32/66/07/32660793415d82324d64efd5d74fa8a7.jpg,"
Introduction to Modeling and Simulation with MATLAB and Python is intended for students and professionals in science, social science, and engineering that wish to learn the principles of computer modeling, as well as basic programming skills. The book content focuses on meeting a set of basic modeling and simulation competencies that were developed as part of several National Science Foundation grants. Even though computer science students are much more expert programmers, they are not often given the opportunity to see how those skills are being applied to solve complex science and engineering problems and may also not be aware of the libraries used by scientists to create those models.   The book interleaves chapters on modeling concepts and related exercises with programming concepts and exercises. The authors start with an introduction to modeling and its importance to current practices in the sciences and engineering. They introduce each of the programming environments and the syntax used to represent variables and compute mathematical equations and functions. As students gain more programming expertise, the authors return to modeling concepts, providing starting code for a variety of exercises where students add additional code to solve the problem and provide an analysis of the outcomes. In this way, the book builds both modeling and programming expertise with a ""just-in-time"" approach so that by the end of the book, students can take on relatively simple modeling example on their own.  Each chapter is supplemented with references to additional reading, tutorials, and exercises that guide students to additional help and allows them to practice both their programming and analytical modeling skills. In addition, each of the programming related chapters is divided into two parts – one for MATLAB and one for Python. In these chapters, the authors also refer to additional online tutorials that students can use if they are having difficulty with any of the topics.  The book culminates with a set of final project exercise suggestions that incorporate both the modeling and programming skills provided in the rest of the volume. Those projects could be undertaken by individuals or small groups of students.   The companion website at http://www.intromodeling.com provides updates to instructions when there are substantial changes in software versions, as well as electronic copies of exercises and the related code. The website also offers a space where people can suggest additional projects they are willing to share as well as comments on the existing projects and exercises throughout the book.

                    Finite Element Modeling and Simulation with ANSYS Workbench combines finite element theory with real-world practice. Providing an introduction to finite element modeling and analysis for those with no prior experience, and written by authors with a combined experience of 30 years teaching the subject, this text presents FEM formulations integrated with relevant hands-on applications using ANSYS Workbench for finite element analysis (FEA).

                    A consensus on the fundamental status of theory of modeling and simulation is emerging – some recognize
the need for a theoretical foundation for M&S as a science. Such a foundation is necessary
to foster the development of M&S-specific methods and the use of such methods to solve real world
problems faced by practitioners. “[Theory of Modeling and Simulation (1976)] gives a theory for simulation
that is based on general system theory and this theory is considered the only major theory
for simulation. This book showed that simulation has a solid foundation and is not just some ad hoc
way of solving problems.” (Sargent, 2017). “Theory of Modeling and Simulation is a major reference
for modeling formalisms, particularly the Discrete Event Systems Specification (DEVS). ... We mention
the System Entity Structures and Model Base (SES/MB) framework as breakthrough in this field
[Model-base management]. It enables efficiency, reusability and interoperability.” (Durak et al., 2017).
For others there is the acknowledgment that certain of the theory’s basic distinctions such as the
separation, and inter-relation, of models and simulators, are at least alternatives to be considered in
addressing core M&S research challenges. Such challenges, and the opportunities to address them, are
identified in areas including conceptual modeling, computational methods and algorithms for simulation,
fidelity issues and uncertainty in M&S, and model reuse, composition, and adaptation (Fujimoto
et al., 2017).
With the assertion that “an established body of knowledge is one of the pillars of an established
discipline” (Durak et al., 2017), this third edition is dedicated to the inference that theory of M&S is an
essential component, and organizing structure, for such a body of knowledge. A prime emphasis of this
edition is on the central role of iterative specification of systems. The importance of iterative system
specification is that it provides a solid foundation for the computational approach to complex systems
manifested in modeling and simulation. While earlier editions introduced iterative specification as the
common form of specification for unifying continuous and discrete systems, this edition employs it
more fundamentally throughout the book. In addition to the new emphasis, throughout the book there
are updates to earlier material outlining significant enhancements from a broad research community. To
accommodate space for such additions some sections of the last edition have been omitted, not because
of obsolescence – indeed, new editions may re-instate these parts.
This Third Edition coordinates with a second book. “Model Engineering for Simulation” (MES) to
provide both a theoretical and application-oriented account of modeling and simulation. This makes
sense as a coordinated “package”, since most of the background theory material will be contained in
this book and the application to model engineering will be contained in MES. This partitioning into
theory and practice avoids unnecessary redundancy. The books will be published synchronously (or as
closely timed as practical). The editor/leaders of the two books have coordinated closely to assure that
a coherent whole emerges that is attractive to a large segment of the simulation community.                ",https://1lib.in/dl/3631856/445b65,674,Academic Press,2019,english,"PDF, 16.42 MB"

It is so powerful that the model parameters may be defined as ""sliders"", which allow the effect of their change on the model behavior to be seen almost immediately. Data may be included for curve fitting, and sensitivity or multiple runs may be performed. The results can be seen simultaneously on multiple-graph windows or by using overlays. The resultant learning effect of this is tremendous. The examples can be varied to fit any real situation, and the suggested exercises provide practical guidance.The extensive experience of the authors, both in university teaching and international courses, is reflected in this well-balanced presentation, which is suitable for the teacher, the student, the chemist or the engineer. This book provides a greater understanding of the formulation and use of mass and energy balances for chemical engineering, in a most stimulating manner.

                    Modeling and Simulation in Python is an introduction to physical modeling using a computational approach.  It is organized in three parts:
• The first part presents discrete models, including a bikeshare system and world population growth.
• The second part introduces first-order systems, including models of infectious disease, thermal systems, and chemical kinetics.
• The third part is about second-order systems, including mechanical systems like projectiles, celestial mechanics, and rotating rigid bodies.
Taking a computational approach makes it possible to work with more realistic models than what you typically see in a first-year physics class, with the option to include features like friction and drag.
Python is an ideal programming language for this material.  It is a good first language for people who have not programmed before, and it provides high-level data structures that are well-suited to express solutions to the problems we are interested in.

The Standard of Good Practice for Information Security (the Standard) has been produced by the Information Security Forum (ISF), an international association of over 300 leading organisations which fund and co-operate in the development of a practical research programme in information security. During the last 18 years the ISF has spent more than US$100 million providing authoritative material to its Members. The ISF's work represents the most comprehensive and integrated set of material anywhere in the world in the area of information risk management.The Standard of Good Practice is a key deliverable from the ISF’s extensive work programme. It has been developed and enhanced over a number of years and has benefited from the results of the many projects run by the ISF.As the ISF is a membership organisation, ISF reports are normally for the exclusive use of ISF Members. However, the ISF has made The Standard of Good Practice available to non-Members with the objectives of:• promoting good practice in information security in all organisations worldwide• helping organisations which are not Members of the ISF to improve their level of security and to reduce their information risk to an acceptable level• assisting in the development of standards that are practical, focused on the right areas, and effective in reducing information risk.The Standard has been developed using a proven methodology to produce the international benchmark for information security. The Standard is updated regularly, refining proven practices and addressing 'hot topics’.The ISF runs a comprehensive Information Security Status Survey that enables Members to gain a clear picture of their organisation's performance across all aspects of information security. The Survey provides a practical, automated tool with which a Member organisation can measure the effectiveness of their information security arrangements, compare them with those of other leading organisations, and assess how well they are performing against The Standard of Good Practice.

Information Security Policies, Procedures, and Standards: A Practitioner's Reference gives you a blueprint on how to develop effective information security policies and procedures. It uses standards such as NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, and COBIT, and regulations such as HIPAA and PCI DSS as the foundation for the content. Highlighting key terminology, policy development concepts and methods, and suggested document structures, it includes examples, checklists, sample policies and procedures, guidelines, and a synopsis of the applicable standards. The author explains how and why procedures are developed and implemented rather than simply provide information and examples. This is an important distinction because no two organizations are exactly alike; therefore, no two sets of policies and procedures are going to be exactly alike. This approach provides the foundation and understanding you need to write effective policies, procedures, and standards clearly and concisely. Developing policies and procedures may seem to be an overwhelming task. However, by relying on the material presented in this book, adopting the policy development techniques, and examining the examples, the task will not seem so daunting. You can use the discussion material to help sell the concepts, which may be the most difficult aspect of the process. Once you have completed a policy or two, you will have the courage to take on even more tasks. Additionally, the skills you acquire will assist you in other areas of your professional and private life, such as expressing an idea clearly and concisely or creating a project plan.

                    Covering aspects from principles and limitations of statistical significance tests to topic set size design and power analysis, this book guides readers to statistically well-designed experiments. Although classical statistical significance tests are to some extent useful in information retrieval (IR) evaluation, they can harm research unless they are used appropriately with the right sample sizes and statistical power and unless the test results are reported properly. The first half of the book is mainly targeted at undergraduate students, and the second half is suitable for graduate students and researchers who regularly conduct laboratory experiments in IR, natural language processing, recommendations, and related fields.Chapters 1-5 review parametric significance tests for comparing system means, namely, t-tests and ANOVAs, and show how easily they can be conducted using Microsoft Excel or R. These chapters also discuss a few multiple comparison procedures for researchers who are interested in comparing every system pair, including a randomised version of Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference test. The chapters then deal with known limitations of classical significance testing and provide practical guidelines for reporting research results regarding comparison of means.Chapters 6 and 7 discuss statistical power. Chapter 6 introduces topic set size design to enable test collection builders to determine an appropriate number of topics to create. Readers can easily use the author's Excel tools for topic set size design based on the paired and two-sample t-tests, one-way ANOVA, and confidence intervals. Chapter 7 describes power-analysis-based methods for determining an appropriate sample size for a new experiment based on a similar experiment done in the past, detailing how to utilize the author's R tools for power analysis and how to interpret the results. Case studies from IR for both Excel-based topic set size design and R-based power analysis are also provided. ",https://1lib.in/dl/3659187/2ecba3,150,Springer,2018,english,"PDF, 5.05 MB"

Due to the fast growth of the Web and the difficulties in finding desired information, efficient and effective information retrieval systems have become more important than ever, and the search engine has become an essential tool for many people.The ranker, a central component in every search engine, is responsible for the matching between processed queries and indexed documents. Because of its central role, great attention has been paid to the research and development of ranking technologies. In addition, ranking is also pivotal for many other information retrieval applications, such as collaborative filtering, definition ranking, question answering, multimedia retrieval, text summarization, and online advertisement. Leveraging machine learning technologies in the ranking process has led to innovative and more effective ranking models, and eventually to a completely new research area called “learning to rank”.Liu first gives a comprehensive review of the major approaches to learning to rank. For each approach he presents the basic framework, with example algorithms, and he discusses its advantages and disadvantages. He continues with some recent advances in learning to rank that cannot be simply categorized into the three major approaches – these include relational ranking, query-dependent ranking, transfer ranking, and semisupervised ranking. His presentation is completed by several examples that apply these technologies to solve real information retrieval problems, and by theoretical discussions on guarantees for ranking performance.This book is written for researchers and graduate students in both information retrieval and machine learning. They will find here the only comprehensive description of the state of the art in a field that has driven the recent advances in search engine development.

                    Information extraction regards the processes of structuring and combining content that is explicitly stated or implied in one or multiple unstructured information sources. It involves a semantic classification and linking of certain pieces of information and is considered as a light form of content understanding by the machine. Currently, there is a considerable interest in integrating the results of information extraction in retrieval systems, because of the growing demand for search engines that return precise answers to flexible information queries. Advanced retrieval models satisfy that need and they rely on tools that automatically build a probabilistic model of the content of a (multi-media) document.The book focuses on content recognition in text. It elaborates on the past and current most successful algorithms and their application in a variety of domains (e.g., news filtering, mining of biomedical text, intelligence gathering, competitive intelligence, legal information searching, and processing of informal text). An important part discusses current statistical and machine learning algorithms for information detection and classification, and integrates their results in probabilistic retrieval models. The book also reveals a number of ideas towards an advanced understanding and synthesis of textual content. The book is aimed at researchers and software developers interested in information extraction and retrieval, but the many illustrations and real world examples make it also suitable as a handbook for students.

                    Graph theory and the fields of natural language processing and information retrieval are well-studied disciplines. Traditionally, these areas have been perceived as distinct, with different algorithms, different applications, and different potential end-users. However, recent research has shown that these disciplines are intimately connected, with a large variety of natural language processing and information retrieval applications finding efficient solutions within graph-theoretical frameworks.    This book extensively covers the use of graph-based algorithms for natural language processing and information retrieval. It brings together topics as diverse as lexical semantics, text summarization, text mining, ontology construction, text classification, and information retrieval, which are connected by the common underlying theme of the use of graph-theoretical methods for text and information processing tasks.

Interested in how an efficient search engine works? Want to know what algorithms are used to rank resulting documents in response to user requests? The authors answer these and other key information retrieval design and implementation questions.This book is not yet another high level text. Instead, algorithms are thoroughly described, making this book ideally suited for both computer science students and practitioners who work on search-related applications. As stated in the foreword, this book provides a current, broad, and detailed overview of the field and is the only one that does so. Examples are used throughout to illustrate the algorithms.The authors explain how a query is ranked against a document collection using either a single or a combination of retrieval strategies, and how an assortment of utilities are integrated into the query processing scheme to improve these rankings. Methods for building and compressing text indexes, querying and retrieving documents in multiple languages, and using parallel or distributed processing to expedite the search are likewise described. This edition is a major expansion of the one published in 1998. Besides updating the entire book with current techniques, it includes new sections on language models, cross-language information retrieval, peer-to-peer processing, XML search, mediators, and duplicate document detection.

This second edition provides a systematic introduction to the work and views of the emerging patent-search research and innovation communities as well as an overview of what has been achieved and, perhaps even more importantly, of what remains to be achieved. It revises many of the contributions of the first edition and adds a significant number of new ones.The first part “Introduction to Patent Searching” includes two overview chapters on the peculiarities of patent searching and on contemporary search technology respectively, and thus sets the scene for the subsequent parts. The second part on “Evaluating Patent Retrieval” then begins with two chapters dedicated to patent evaluation campaigns, followed by two chapters discussing complementary issues from the perspective of patent searchers and from the perspective of related domains, notably legal search. “High Recall Search” includes four completely new chapters dealing with the issue of finding only the relevant documents in a reasonable time span. The last (and with six papers the largest) part on “Special Topics in Patent Information Retrieval” covers a large spectrum of research in the patent field, from classification and image processing to translation. Lastly, the book is completed by an outlook on open issues and future research. Several of the chapters have been jointly written by intellectual property and information retrieval experts. However, members of both communities with a background different to that of the primary author have reviewed the chapters, making the book accessible to both the patent search community and to the information retrieval research community.

                    This volume celebrates the twentieth anniversary of CLEF - the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum for the first ten years, and the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum since – and traces its evolution over these first two decades. CLEF’s main mission is to promote research, innovation and development of information retrieval (IR) systems by anticipating trends in information management in order to stimulate advances in the field of IR system experimentation and evaluation. The book is divided into six parts. Parts I and II provide background and context, with the first part explaining what is meant by experimental evaluation and the underlying theory, and describing how this has been interpreted in CLEF and in other internationally recognized evaluation initiatives. Part II presents research architectures and infrastructures that have been developed to manage experimental data and to provide evaluation services in CLEF and elsewhere. Parts III, IV and V represent the core of the book, presenting some of the most significant evaluation activities in CLEF, ranging from the early multilingual text processing exercises to the later, more sophisticated experiments on multimodal collections in diverse genres and media. In all cases, the focus is not only on describing “what has been achieved”, but above all on “what has been learnt”. The final part examines the impact CLEF has had on the research world and discusses current and future challenges, both academic and industrial, including the relevance of IR benchmarking in industrial settings. Mainly intended for researchers in academia and industry, it also offers useful insights and tips for practitioners in industry working on the evaluation and performance issues of IR tools, and graduate students specializing in information retrieval.

                    Information retrieval, IR, is the science of extracting information from documents. It 
can be viewed in a number of ways: logical, probabilistic and vector space models are some of the most important. In this book, the author, one of the leading researchers in the area, shows how these three views can be combined in one mathematical framework, the very one used to formulate the general principles of quantum mechanics.Using this framework, van Rijsbergen presents a new theory for the
 foundations of IR, in particular a new theory of measurement. He shows how a document can be represented as a vector in Hilbert space, and the document’s relevance by an Hermitian operator. All the usual quantum-mechanical notions, such as uncertainty, superposition and observable, have their IR-theoretic analogues. But the approach is more than just analogy: the standard theorems can be applied to address
 problems in IR, such as pseudo-relevance feedback, relevance feedback and ostensive retrieval. The relation with quantum computing is also examined. To help keep the book self-contained, appendices with background material on physics and mathematics are included, and each chapter ends with some suggestions for further reading.This is an important book for all those working in IR, AI and natural language processing.

This book introduces the quantum mechanical framework to information retrieval scientists seeking a new perspective on foundational problems. As such, it concentrates on the main notions of the quantum mechanical framework and describes an innovative range of concepts and tools for modeling information representation and retrieval processes. The book is divided into four chapters. Chapter 1 illustrates the main modeling concepts for information retrieval (including Boolean logic, vector spaces, probabilistic models, and machine-learning based approaches), which will be examined further in subsequent chapters. Next, chapter 2 briefly explains the main concepts of the quantum mechanical framework, focusing on approaches linked to information retrieval such as interference, superposition and entanglement. Chapter 3 then reviews the research conducted at the intersection between information retrieval and the quantum mechanical framework. The chapter is subdivided into a number of topics, and each description ends with a section suggesting the most important reference resources.

                    The growth of the Internet and the availability of enormous  volumes of data in digital form has necessitated intense interest in  techniques for assisting the user in locating data of interest. The  Internet has over 350 million pages of data and is expected to reach  over one billion pages by the year 2000. Buried on the Internet are  both valuable nuggets for answering questions as well as large  quantities of information the average person does not care about. The  Digital Library effort is also progressing, with the goal of migrating  from the traditional book environment to a digital library  environment.   Information Retrieval Systems: Theory and Implementation  provides a theoretical and practical explanation of the latest  advancements in information retrieval and their application to  existing systems. It takes a system approach, discussing all aspects  of an Information Retrieval System. The importance of the Internet and  its associated hypertext-linked structure is put into perspective as a  new type of information retrieval data structure. The total system  approach also includes discussion of the human interface and the  importance of information visualization for identification of relevant  information. The theoretical metrics used to describe information  systems are expanded to discuss their practical application in the  uncontrolled environment of real world systems.   Information Retrieval Systems: Theory and Implementation is  suitable as a textbook for a graduate-level course on information  retrieval, and as a reference for researchers and practitioners in  industry.

                    This book discusses in detail the latest trends in sentiment analysis,focusing on “how online reviews and feedback reflect the opinions of users and have led to a major shift in the decision-making process at organizations.” Social networking has become essential in today’s society. In the past, people’s decisions to buy certain products (and companies’ efforts to sell them) were largely based on advertisements, surveys, focus groups, consultants, and the opinions of friends and relatives. But now this is no longer limited to one’s circle of friends, family or small surveys;it has spread globally to online social media in the form of blogs, posts, tweets, social networking sites, review sites and so on. Though not always easy, the transition from surveys to social media is certainly lucrative. Business analytical reports have shown that many organizations have improved their sales, marketing and strategy, setting up new policies and making decisions based on opinion mining techniques.

This book offers comprehensive coverage of information retrieval by considering both Text Based Information Retrieval (TBIR) and Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), together with new research topics. The approach to TBIR is based on creating a thesaurus, as well as event classification and detection. N-gram thesaurus generation for query refinement offers a new method for improving the precision of retrieval, while event classification and detection approaches aid in the classification and organization of information using web documents for domain-specific retrieval applications. In turn, with regard to content based image retrieval (CBIR) the book presents a histogram construction method, which is based on human visual perceptions of color. The book’s overarching goal is to introduce readers to new ideas in an easy-to-follow manner.  ",https://1lib.in/dl/3664508/888c47,,Springer Singapore,2018,english,"PDF, 6.78 MB"

Recent years have been characterized by tremendous advances in quantum information and communication, both theoretically and experimentally. In addition, mathematical methods of quantum information and quantum probability have begun spreading to other areas of research, beyond physics. One exciting new possibility involves applying these methods to information science and computer science (without direct relation to the problems of creation of quantum computers). The aim of this Special Volume is to encourage scientists, especially the new generation (master and PhD students), working in computer science and related mathematical fields to explore novel possibilities based on the mathematical formalisms of quantum information and probability. The contributing authors, who hail from various countries, combine extensive quantum methods expertise with real-world experience in application of these methods to computer science. The problems considered chiefly concern quantum information-probability based modeling in the following areas: information foraging; interactive quantum information access; deep convolutional neural networks; decision making; quantum dynamics; open quantum systems; and theory of contextual probability. The book offers young scientists (students, PhD, postdocs) an essential introduction to applying the mathematical apparatus of quantum theory to computer science, information retrieval, and information processes.

With the proliferation of huge amounts of (heterogeneous) data on the Web, the importance of information retrieval (IR) has grown considerably over the last few years. Big players in the computer industry, such as Google, Microsoft and Yahoo!, are the primary contributors of technology for fast access to Web-based information; and searching capabilities are now integrated into most information systems, ranging from business management software and customer relationship systems to social networks and mobile phone applications.Ceri and his co-authors aim at taking their readers from the foundations of modern information retrieval to the most advanced challenges of Web IR. To this end, their book is divided into three parts. The first part addresses the principles of IR and provides a systematic and compact description of basic information retrieval techniques (including binary, vector space and probabilistic models as well as natural language search processing) before focusing on its application to the Web. Part two addresses the foundational aspects of Web IR by discussing the general architecture of search engines (with a focus on the crawling and indexing processes), describing link analysis methods (specifically Page Rank and HITS), addressing recommendation and diversification, and finally presenting advertising in search (the main source of revenues for search engines). The third and final part describes advanced aspects of Web search, each chapter providing a self-contained, up-to-date survey on current Web research directions. Topics in this part include meta-search and multi-domain search, semantic search, search in the context of multimedia data, and crowd search.The book is ideally suited to courses on information retrieval, as it covers all Web-independent foundational aspects. Its presentation is self-contained and does not require prior background knowledge. It can also be used in the context of classic courses on data management, allowing the instructor to cover both structured and unstructured data in various formats. Its classroom use is facilitated by a set of slides, which can be downloaded from www.search-computing.org.
